ERROR: YAMLException: duplicated mapping key (paper.qmd, 19:4)

      ~~
20: #| warning: false
ChatGPT said:

The error indicates that there is a duplicated mapping key in the YAML metadata section of your paper.qmd file. In YAML, keys must be unique, and having duplicate keys (such as include appearing twice) causes a parsing error.

Here’s how you can fix it:

Locate the Duplicate Key:

The error message points to line 19: #| include: false. This might mean that this key (include) has already been defined elsewhere in your YAML metadata.
Check the YAML Metadata Section:

Open paper.qmd and carefully review the YAML block at the beginning or any metadata specified later in the file. Look for multiple occurrences of #| include.
Consolidate or Remove Duplicates:

If there are duplicates, decide which one to keep and remove the redundant lines.
For example, the problematic section might look like this:

yaml
Copy code
#| message: false
#| include: false
#| include: true
#| warning: false
Here, you have two include keys with conflicting values. Fix it by deciding on one value:

yaml
Copy code
#| message: false
#| include: false
#| warning: false
Re-run the Command:
After resolving the issue, try running the Quarto preview command again:

bash
Copy code
quarto preview paper.qmd --to pdf --no-watch-inputs --no-browse
If the issue persists, let me know, and I can help debug further.

The error in your screenshot indicates a problem with the LaTeX math environment in your paper.qmd file. The key issue is that the LaTeX expression in lines 92-94 ($$ \text{daily_return} = \frac{\text{adjusted}}{\text{Lag_1}} - 1 $$) is improperly formatted.

Fixing the Issue
Ensure Proper Use of Inline and Display Math:

The $$ ... $$ syntax is used for display math (centered on its own line), while $ ... $ is used for inline math.
Make sure the math block is properly enclosed with $$ and has no mismatched or extra $.
Correct Formatting of LaTeX Expressions:

Double-check the LaTeX code for typos, especially around braces ({}) and special characters like _ and \.
In your case, the LaTeX seems correct, but sometimes extra spaces or invisible characters may cause issues.

Example corrected block:

latex
Copy code
$$
\text{daily_return} = \frac{\text{adjusted}}{\text{Lag}_1} - 1
$$
Check the Surrounding Text:

If there are unmatched math delimiters earlier in the file (e.g., an unclosed $), it might affect this part of the document. Look for earlier math expressions and ensure they are properly closed.
Rerun the Preview Command: After making corrections, try running:

bash
Copy code
quarto preview paper.qmd --to pdf
If the error persists, let me know, and I can provide additional guidance!

The issue stems from the way LaTeX handles math environments. In this case, it's likely caused by the $$ math environment, which can sometimes conflict in certain rendering pipelines like Quarto. Here's how to fix it:

Solution: Switch to Quarto-Supported Math Block Syntax
Quarto supports both LaTeX and Markdown, but to avoid these errors, it's better to use the following syntax for math blocks:

markdown
Copy code
- **`daily_return`**: The percentage change in adjusted closing prices relative to the previous day, calculated as:

```{=tex}
\[
\text{daily_return} = \frac{\text{adjusted}}{\text{Lag_1}} - 1
\]
This variable normalizes price changes for comparability across time and stocks.

symbol_encoded: A numeric encoding of the stock ticker symbol, allowing the categorical symbol variable to be included in the modeling process.
vbnet
Copy code

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Avoid `$$ ... $$` Syntax in Quarto**:
   The `$$` syntax is standard in raw LaTeX, but Quarto sometimes interprets it differently or treats it as an inline element when not properly separated from surrounding text. Switching to the fenced math block ensures compatibility.

2. **Use `{=tex}` for Explicit LaTeX Blocks**:
   By explicitly marking the block as LaTeX, Quarto ensures it's processed correctly, without ambiguity.

3. **Ensure Proper Formatting**:
   If any extra characters or spaces exist in or around the LaTeX block, they can cause errors. Double-check for invisible formatting issues, especially if copying from another editor.

### Alternative: Inline Math
If you prefer inline math, you can rewrite it with single `$` delimiters:

```markdown
- **`daily_return`**: The percentage change in adjusted closing prices relative to the previous day, calculated as:

`daily_return = \frac{\text{adjusted}}{\text{Lag_1}} - 1`

This variable normalizes price changes for comparability across time and stocks.
Test the Fix
After making these changes, re-run your Quarto preview command:

bash
Copy code
quarto preview paper.qmd --to pdf
If the issue persists, feel free to share the relevant portion of your document for further debugging.






You said:
i need in $$...$$. or can you change the description so it doesn't have equation?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you prefer to remove the equation and describe the formula instead, here's a revised description:

daily_return: The percentage change in adjusted closing prices relative to the previous day. This value is calculated by dividing the adjusted closing price by its value from the previous day and subtracting 1. This variable normalizes price changes, making them comparable across time and stocks.
This eliminates the equation while retaining the full meaning of the calculation. Let me know if you’d like to refine it further!

Error: Functions that produce HTML output found in document targeting pdf output.
Please change the output type of this document to HTML.
If you're aiming to have some HTML widgets shown in non-HTML format as a screenshot,
please install webshot or webshot2 R package for knitr to do the screenshot, and configure it by looking at its documentation.
Alternatively, you can allow HTML output in non-HTML formats
by adding this option to the YAML front-matter of
your quarto file:

  prefer-html: true

Note however that the HTML output will not be visible in non-HTML formats.

Execution halted
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error suggests that your paper.qmd file includes functions or elements (like HTML widgets) that are designed to generate HTML output, but you are attempting to compile it as a PDF. Quarto cannot directly embed HTML elements into PDF outputs.

Solutions
1. Change Output to HTML
If the output is intended to include interactive HTML elements, you should change the document's output format to HTML in the YAML front matter:

yaml
Copy code
output: html_document
This will allow HTML elements to render properly.

2. Use Screenshots for HTML Widgets
If you need the document to remain a PDF, you can render the HTML widgets as static images. Install the webshot or webshot2 R package, and configure it to take screenshots of the widgets:

Install the package:
R
Copy code
install.packages("webshot2")
Add the following option to your YAML front matter:
yaml
Copy code
format:
  pdf:
    prefer-html: true
This allows Quarto to include screenshots of HTML widgets in the PDF output.

3. Remove HTML Widgets
If the HTML widgets are not essential, replace them with static alternatives, such as tables or charts rendered using a static R package like ggplot2.

4. Use prefer-html: true
To allow HTML output in the PDF document (though it won't be visible), modify the YAML front matter:

yaml
Copy code
format:
  pdf:
    prefer-html: true
Steps to Debug
Identify where HTML widgets are used in your document (e.g., datatable, plotly, or similar interactive elements).
Replace or modify the offending elements using one of the solutions above.
If you share the relevant parts of the file or details about the HTML elements used, I can provide more specific guidance!

fix. i dont' want html
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you don't want HTML output, you can replace kable and kable_styling with options that work in non-HTML formats, such as knitr::kable with the "latex" or "simple" format. Here's the updated code:

Updated Code for Non-HTML Output
r
Copy code
# Select and display random sample of predictive variables from analysis_data
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

analysis_data %>%
  select(
    Lag_1,
    Rolling_Mean_7,
    sma_20,
    sma_50,
    volatility,
    daily_return,
    symbol_encoded
  ) %>%
  sample_n(5) %>% # Randomly sample 5 rows
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ round(., 2))) %>% # Round to 2 decimal places
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c(
      "Lag_1",
      "Rolling Mean (7-Day)",
      "SMA (20-Day)",
      "SMA (50-Day)",
      "Volatility",
      "Daily Return",
      "Symbol (Encoded)"
    ),
    format = "latex", # Use "latex" for PDF output
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
Explanation of Changes:
Replaced format = "html": Changed to format = "latex" for LaTeX/PDF output. If you want a simpler table for text output, use format = "simple".

Removed kable_styling: This function is specific to HTML output and not supported in PDF/LaTeX.

Kept kable: It supports multiple formats (LaTeX, markdown, simple text), making it compatible with PDF outputs.

Notes:
Ensure that your Quarto document is set to render as a PDF.
If you use format = "latex", the document will generate a proper LaTeX table in the PDF output. For other formats like markdown, use format = "markdown".
Run the updated code and compile your document; it should now work without attempting to produce HTML output.

just give me simple kable with column names
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here is a simplified version of your code using kable with basic column names for non-HTML output:

r
Copy code
# Select and display random sample of predictive variables from analysis_data
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

analysis_data %>%
  select(
    Lag_1,
    Rolling_Mean_7,
    sma_20,
    sma_50,
    volatility,
    daily_return,
    symbol_encoded
  ) %>%
  sample_n(5) %>% # Randomly sample 5 rows
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ round(., 2))) %>% # Round to 2 decimal places
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c(
      "Lag_1",
      "Rolling Mean (7-Day)",
      "SMA (20-Day)",
      "SMA (50-Day)",
      "Volatility",
      "Daily Return",
      "Symbol (Encoded)"
    )
  )
Key Adjustments:
No Additional Formatting: Used kable without extra styling or formatting.
Compatible with Any Output: Works with PDF, Word, or plain text output formats.
This will generate a simple table with the specified column names.

Visualizations for Model Diagnostics
Below are R code chunks to generate feature importance and residual analysis plots, along with additional diagnostic checks like prediction accuracy and error distributions.

1. Feature Importance Visualization
Feature importance helps identify which predictors contribute the most to the model's predictions.

r
Copy code
# Load the trained model
nov_model <- readRDS("models/nov_model.rds")

# Extract feature importance
importance_matrix <- xgb.importance(
  feature_names = colnames(X_train_nov),
  model = nov_model
)

# Plot feature importance
xgb.plot.importance(importance_matrix, rel_to_first = TRUE, top_n = 10)
2. Residual Analysis
Residual analysis checks the difference between predicted and actual values, identifying patterns in model errors.

r
Copy code
# Make predictions on the training set
predictions_nov <- predict(nov_model, X_train_nov)

# Calculate residuals
residuals_nov <- y_train_nov - predictions_nov

# Residual vs. Fitted Plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(Fitted = predictions_nov, Residuals = residuals_nov), aes(x = Fitted, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs. Fitted Values", x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()
3. Error Distribution
Visualizing the distribution of residuals can help check if errors follow a normal distribution (a key assumption in regression models).

r
Copy code
# Residual distribution
ggplot(data.frame(Residuals = residuals_nov), aes(x = Residuals)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Residual Distribution", x = "Residuals", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
4. Prediction Accuracy
Compare predicted and actual values to evaluate the model's performance visually.

r
Copy code
# Scatter plot of predicted vs actual values
ggplot(data.frame(Predicted = predictions_nov, Actual = y_train_nov), aes(x = Predicted, y = Actual)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Predicted vs Actual Values", x = "Predicted Values", y = "Actual Values") +
  theme_minimal()
Additional Diagnostic Checks
Here are other diagnostics you can include:

Learning Curve:

Evaluate model performance (e.g., RMSE) across iterations.
r
Copy code
# Plot learning curve
xgb.plot.training(
  xgb_model = nov_model,
  eval_metric = "rmse"
)
Cross-Validation Results:

Perform XGBoost cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.
r
Copy code
cv <- xgb.cv(
  data = dtrain_nov,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.1,
  nrounds = 100,
  nfold = 5,
  objective = "reg:squarederror",
  verbose = 0
)

# Plot cross-validation results
cv_results <- as.data.frame(cv$evaluation_log)
ggplot(cv_results, aes(x = iter)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = train_rmse_mean, color = "Train")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = test_rmse_mean, color = "Test")) +
  labs(title = "Cross-Validation RMSE", x = "Iterations", y = "RMSE") +
  theme_minimal()
These visualizations provide insights into model performance, feature contributions, and potential improvement areas. Let me know if you'd like further enhancements or explanations!






You said:
which ones are necessary for the model diagnostics section?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For a Model Diagnostics section, the most critical elements are those that evaluate the model's performance and validate the assumptions made during the modeling process. Here's a prioritized list of diagnostic checks that are necessary:

Essential Diagnostics
Feature Importance:

Why: Helps identify which variables are driving the model's predictions and ensures they align with domain knowledge.
Code:
r
Copy code
importance_matrix <- xgb.importance(
  feature_names = colnames(X_train_nov),
  model = nov_model
)
xgb.plot.importance(importance_matrix, rel_to_first = TRUE, top_n = 10)
Residual Analysis:

Why: Residuals should ideally be randomly distributed around 0, indicating no systematic bias or patterns in errors.
Key Plot: Residuals vs. Fitted Values
Code:
r
Copy code
residuals_nov <- y_train_nov - predict(nov_model, X_train_nov)
ggplot(data.frame(Fitted = predict(nov_model, X_train_nov), Residuals = residuals_nov), aes(x = Fitted, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs. Fitted Values", x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()
Error Distribution (Histogram of Residuals):

Why: The distribution of residuals should be approximately normal (bell-shaped). Skewed or multimodal distributions may indicate issues like missing variables or heteroscedasticity.
Code:
r
Copy code
ggplot(data.frame(Residuals = residuals_nov), aes(x = Residuals)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Residual Distribution", x = "Residuals", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
Predicted vs. Actual Values:

Why: This visual confirms how well the model predicts the target variable. A strong model should show points clustered around a 45° line.
Code:
r
Copy code
ggplot(data.frame(Predicted = predict(nov_model, X_train_nov), Actual = y_train_nov), aes(x = Predicted, y = Actual)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Predicted vs Actual Values", x = "Predicted Values", y = "Actual Values") +
  theme_minimal()
Optional/Advanced Diagnostics
These checks are helpful but not strictly necessary unless your audience expects more detailed validation:

Learning Curve:

Why: Evaluates if the model is overfitting or underfitting during training. A divergence between training and validation RMSE indicates overfitting.
Code:
r
Copy code
xgb.plot.training(
  xgb_model = nov_model,
  eval_metric = "rmse"
)
Cross-Validation Results:

Why: Validates the model's performance across multiple folds to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
Code:
r
Copy code
cv <- xgb.cv(
  data = dtrain_nov,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.1,
  nrounds = 100,
  nfold = 5,
  objective = "reg:squarederror",
  verbose = 0
)

cv_results <- as.data.frame(cv$evaluation_log)
ggplot(cv_results, aes(x = iter)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = train_rmse_mean, color = "Train")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = test_rmse_mean, color = "Test")) +
  labs(title = "Cross-Validation RMSE", x = "Iterations", y = "RMSE") +
  theme_minimal()
Summary for Your Diagnostics Section
Include these:

Feature Importance: Explain which features are most predictive.
Residual Analysis:
Residuals vs. Fitted Values.
Residual Distribution (histogram).
Predicted vs. Actual Values: Highlight model accuracy.
Optionally:

Add Learning Curve or Cross-Validation Results for advanced analysis or if overfitting/underfitting is a concern.

can i download data from yahoo finance api through tidyquant using R to write a paper that predicts FAANG tech stock prices? do i need other resources to build a model that predicts the stock prices?

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use the tidyquant package in R to download data from Yahoo Finance for FAANG stocks (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google/Alphabet) and use it to build a model predicting their stock prices. Here's an overview of what you'll need and additional resources to build a robust model:

1. Downloading Data
tidyquant provides functions to download historical stock data:

Use tq_get() to fetch stock price data.
Specify tickers (e.g., META, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL) and desired date range.
Example:

R
Copy code
library(tidyquant)

# Define tickers and download data
faang_tickers <- c("META", "AMZN", "AAPL", "NFLX", "GOOGL")
faang_data <- tq_get(faang_tickers, from = "2020-01-01", to = "2024-12-01", get = "stock.prices")

# View the structure
head(faang_data)
This will fetch daily data for Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted Close prices.

2. Data Preparation
Stock price prediction requires clean and structured data. Steps include:

Feature Engineering: Create additional variables like moving averages, volatility, and returns.
Normalization: Scale data to handle large differences in feature magnitudes.
Missing Data Handling: Ensure no missing values or impute appropriately.
Example of feature engineering:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)

faang_features <- faang_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1,
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(daily_return, n = 20)
  ) %>%
  na.omit()
3. Building a Predictive Model
For prediction, consider these models:

Time Series Models: ARIMA, Prophet, or state-space models.
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks (e.g., LSTMs for time series).
Example Workflow:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Use models like ARIMA or machine learning libraries such as caret, xgboost, or tensorflow in R.
ARIMA example:

R
Copy code
library(forecast)

# Select a single stock for ARIMA modeling
google_data <- faang_features %>% filter(symbol == "GOOGL") %>% select(date, adjusted)

# Convert to time series
google_ts <- ts(google_data$adjusted, frequency = 252) # Assuming ~252 trading days/year

# Fit ARIMA model
fit_arima <- auto.arima(google_ts)

# Forecast
forecast_arima <- forecast(fit_arima, h = 30) # Predict next 30 days
plot(forecast_arima)
4. Additional Resources
While tidyquant and R's built-in capabilities are powerful, consider:

Technical Analysis: Use packages like quantmod for advanced indicators.
Deep Learning for Stock Prediction: Try keras or tensorflow for models like LSTMs, which handle sequential data effectively.
Econometrics Models: Packages like plm or nlme for panel data.

what is the best approach? 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The best approach to building a predictive model for FAANG stock prices depends on the specific goals of your project (e.g., prediction accuracy, explainability, or showcasing advanced methods). Below is a step-by-step roadmap outlining an optimal approach while balancing simplicity, performance, and interpretability.

1. Problem Definition
Clearly define your objective: Are you predicting closing prices, daily returns, or directional trends?
Identify the prediction horizon (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly).
2. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Sources:
Use tidyquant to fetch historical stock price data.
Complement with external data (e.g., macroeconomic indicators, sentiment analysis).
Preprocessing Steps:
Handle missing values using interpolation or removal.

You said:
Can I predict FAANG stock prices for Q1 2025? or is it better to predict for december 2024? i only have data ranging to november 30th, 2024
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Given your data ranges only up to November 30, 2024, predicting stock prices for December 2024 is generally more reliable than predicting for Q1 2025. Here's why:

Prediction Horizon and Accuracy
December 2024 (Short-Term Horizon):

Predictions for December are closer to your training data.
Time-series and machine learning models are more accurate in the short term because:
Trends and patterns from recent data are more relevant.
There's less uncertainty from external, unpredictable factors.
Q1 2025 (Longer-Term Horizon):

Extending predictions beyond the range of training data increases uncertainty.
Factors like earnings reports, interest rate changes, and geopolitical events (which models cannot account for) may heavily impact stock prices.
Challenges with Long-Term Prediction
Data Extrapolation:

Models tend to extrapolate trends from historical data, which may not hold true over longer periods.
For FAANG stocks, external shocks (e.g., new product launches, regulatory changes) can dramatically alter prices.
Model Drift:

Assumptions about the data distribution (stationarity, market behavior) might not remain valid over longer timeframes.
Feature Relevance:

Predictors like moving averages or recent volatility lose predictive power the farther you forecast into the future.
Suggested Approach
Predict for December 2024:

Use your existing data to predict prices for December.
Validate the model by splitting data into training (e.g., up to October 31, 2024) and testing (e.g., November 2024).
Extend to Q1 2025 (Cautiously):

If needed, extend predictions for Q1 2025 but clearly note in your paper the increasing uncertainty.
Consider:
Using ensemble methods to blend predictions from different models.
Adding external indicators (e.g., interest rates, sector growth predictions).
Implementation Tips
For December 2024:

Use traditional forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, ETS) or short-horizon machine learning models.
Evaluate prediction accuracy on a recent subset of your data (e.g., September-November 2024).
For Q1 2025:

Explore scenario-based forecasts.
Incorporate macroeconomic predictions or qualitative analysis to supplement your quantitative model.
Conclusion
Predicting December 2024 is more practical and defensible.
If you include Q1 2025, frame it as an exploratory or scenario-based analysis with caveats about uncertainty.
Would you like guidance on implementing either approach?






You said:
i want to predict for december 2024
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To predict FAANG stock prices for December 2024, you can use a structured approach that focuses on leveraging your existing data (up to November 30, 2024). Here's how you can proceed:

1. Data Preparation
a) Split Data
Divide your data into training (e.g., Jan 2020 – Oct 2024) and testing (e.g., Nov 2024).
Use the training data to fit your model and the testing data to evaluate it.
b) Feature Engineering
Generate relevant features for prediction:
Time-based features: Month, day, quarter.
Technical indicators: Moving averages (20-day, 50-day), Bollinger Bands, RSI.
Volatility measures: Rolling standard deviation.
Returns: Daily, weekly returns.
Example:
R
Copy code
library(tidyquant)
library(dplyr)

faang_data <- tq_get(c("META", "AMZN", "AAPL", "NFLX", "GOOGL"), 
                     from = "2020-01-01", to = "2024-11-30") %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    month = lubridate::month(date),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  na.omit()
2. Model Selection
a) ARIMA/ETS for Time Series Prediction
Best for single-stock predictions, using adjusted price.
b) Machine Learning Models for Multivariate Prediction
Models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks can incorporate multiple features across all FAANG stocks.
3. Predict Using ARIMA
Use ARIMA to predict stock prices for December 2024.

R
Copy code
library(forecast)

# Filter for a single stock (e.g., Google)
google_data <- faang_data %>% filter(symbol == "GOOGL") %>% select(date, adjusted)

# Convert to time series
google_ts <- ts(google_data$adjusted, frequency = 252) # ~252 trading days per year

# Fit ARIMA model
fit_arima <- auto.arima(google_ts)

# Forecast for December 2024 (next 22 trading days)
forecast_arima <- forecast(fit_arima, h = 22)

# Plot forecast
plot(forecast_arima)
4. Predict Using Machine Learning
Use a multivariate model for enhanced prediction accuracy.

a) Data Preparation:
Use the engineered features and split into training and testing sets.
R
Copy code
# Split into training and testing sets
train <- faang_data %>% filter(date <= as.Date("2024-10-31"))
test <- faang_data %>% filter(date > as.Date("2024-10-31"))
b) Train a Random Forest or XGBoost Model:
R
Copy code
library(xgboost)

# Prepare matrices for XGBoost
X_train <- as.matrix(train %>% select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return))
y_train <- train$adjusted

X_test <- as.matrix(test %>% select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return))
y_test <- test$adjusted

# Train the model
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
fit_xgb <- xgboost(data = dtrain, max.depth = 6, eta = 0.3, nrounds = 100, verbose = 0)

# Predict December 2024 prices
predictions <- predict(fit_xgb, X_test)
5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate your model using the testing set (Nov 2024):
RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error.
MAE: Mean Absolute Error.
MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error.
Example:

R
Copy code
library(Metrics)
rmse(y_test, predictions)
mae(y_test, predictions)
mape(y_test, predictions)
6. Visualization
Create clear visualizations for your paper:

Historical vs. Predicted Prices: Line plot for December.
Feature Importance: Bar chart to show which features contribute most to the prediction (for ML models).
Example:

R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Predicted vs. Actual
results <- data.frame(Date = test$date, Actual = y_test, Predicted = predictions)
ggplot(results, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Actual, color = "Actual")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Predicted, color = "Predicted")) +
  labs(title = "Predicted vs. Actual Prices for December 2024", y = "Price", x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal()
7. Discuss Limitations
Include these points in your paper:

Assumptions: Models assume historical patterns persist in December.
External Factors: Unexpected events in December (e.g., earnings, policy changes) might impact prices.
Model-Specific Risks: ARIMA focuses on historical price trends; machine learning may overfit.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the column symbol is not present in your analysis_data dataset, which means group_by(symbol) is attempting to group by a column that does not exist.

Here’s how to debug and resolve the issue:

Steps to Fix
Check for the symbol Column

Confirm if the symbol column exists in your analysis_data. Use:
R
Copy code
colnames(analysis_data)
If symbol is missing, you need to ensure it is included when downloading or preparing the dataset.
Verify the Structure of Your Dataset

Check the structure of analysis_data to confirm it matches expectations:
R
Copy code
str(analysis_data)
head(analysis_data)
Ensure symbol or an equivalent column (e.g., ticker, stock name) exists.
Add the symbol Column if Missing

If you’re working with a single stock or your data lacks the symbol column, add it explicitly:
R
Copy code
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(symbol = "GOOGL")  # Replace "GOOGL" with the appropriate stock ticker
Modify the Script to Work Without symbol

If symbol is unnecessary and you’re processing data for one stock, remove the group_by(symbol) line:
R
Copy code
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    # Technical indicators
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1,
    # Time-based features
    month = lubridate::month(date, label = TRUE),
    day_of_week = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  na.omit()
Root Cause
If you downloaded FAANG data using tq_get() but filtered for a single stock, the symbol column may have been dropped.
Ensure you’re using the original dataset that contains all columns, including symbol.
Next Steps
Confirm if symbol exists in your data.
Add the symbol column or remove the grouping if it’s not required.
Re-run the script.

The error indicates that X_train, which is supposed to be a numeric matrix, contains non-numeric data (likely character strings). This could happen if the selected columns (sma_20, sma_50, volatility, and daily_return) contain invalid values or the dataset includes grouping information (symbol) as mentioned in the warning message.

Here’s how to resolve this issue:

Steps to Fix
Inspect X_train

Check the structure and content of X_train to identify any non-numeric data:
R
Copy code
str(X_train)
head(X_train)
Ensure all columns in X_train are numeric. If they are not, investigate the cause (e.g., unprocessed data, grouping variables, or NA values).
Check for Grouping Variables

The message "Adding missing grouping variables: symbol" indicates that train is still grouped by symbol. Ungroup the data before selecting columns:
R
Copy code
train <- train %>% ungroup()
Ensure All Selected Columns Are Numeric

Convert any character or factor columns to numeric before creating X_train:
R
Copy code
X_train <- train %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%
  as.matrix()
Verify the Training Labels (y_train)

Ensure y_train is numeric and matches the number of rows in X_train:
R
Copy code
y_train <- as.numeric(train$adjusted)
Updated Script
Here’s an updated section of the script to fix the issue:

R
Copy code
# Ensure the data is ungrouped
train <- train %>% ungroup()

# Prepare X_train as a numeric matrix
X_train <- train %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Prepare y_train as a numeric vector
y_train <- as.numeric(train$adjusted)

# Create XGBoost DMatrix
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
Additional Debugging Steps
Check for Missing or NA Values: Ensure no missing values exist in the selected columns:

R
Copy code
colSums(is.na(X_train))
Verify Column Names in train: Confirm that sma_20, sma_50, volatility, and daily_return exist in the dataset:

R
Copy code
colnames(train)
Consistency Between Features and Labels: Verify that the number of rows in X_train matches the length of y_train:

R
Copy code
nrow(X_train) == length(y_train)

The issue arises because symbol, which is a character column, is included in the matrix X_train. Additionally, the other columns are being treated as character strings instead of numeric. To resolve this, you need to exclude symbol from the feature selection and convert the remaining columns to numeric.

Corrected Script
Exclude Non-Numeric Columns

symbol should not be included in the matrix since it is not a feature for modeling.
Convert Numeric Features Properly

Ensure all feature columns are numeric.
Here’s the corrected script:

R
Copy code
# Ensure the data is ungrouped
train <- train %>% ungroup()

# Prepare X_train as a numeric matrix
X_train <- train %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude 'symbol'
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%         # Ensure all are numeric
  as.matrix()

# Prepare y_train as a numeric vector
y_train <- as.numeric(train$adjusted)

# Create XGBoost DMatrix
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
Key Changes
Exclude symbol: select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) ensures only numeric columns are included.
Convert Columns to Numeric: mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) converts all selected columns to numeric.
Convert adjusted to Numeric: y_train <- as.numeric(train$adjusted) ensures labels are numeric.
Verification
After making these changes, verify:

Structure of X_train:

R
Copy code
str(X_train)
Should return a numeric matrix with no character columns.
Matching Dimensions:

R
Copy code
nrow(X_train) == length(y_train)
This should return TRUE.
No Missing Values:

R
Copy code
any(is.na(X_train))
This should return FALSE.

Here is the prediction script that uses your trained XGBoost model to make predictions for December 2024.

Prediction Script
This script assumes the trained XGBoost model (faang_model.xgb) and cleaned test data are available.

R
Copy code
# Libraries
library(xgboost)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load Cleaned Data
faang_data <- read_csv("faang_data_cleaned.csv")

# Load the Trained Model
fit_xgb <- xgb.load("faang_model.xgb")

# Filter Test Data (November - December 2024)
test <- faang_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31"))

# Prepare Testing Features
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Make Predictions for December 2024
predictions <- predict(fit_xgb, X_test)

# Combine Predictions with Actual Data for Comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save Results to a CSV File
write_csv(results, "faang_predictions_december_2024.csv")

# View Results
head(results)
Steps in the Script
Load Cleaned Data:

Reads the cleaned dataset (faang_data_cleaned.csv) prepared in the cleaning step.
Filter Test Data:

Focuses on dates after October 31, 2024 (i.e., November and December).
Prepare Features:

Selects relevant columns (sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return).
Converts them to a numeric matrix for the XGBoost model.
Make Predictions:

Uses the predict() function with the trained XGBoost model and the test features.
Combine Predictions with Actual Data:

Adds predictions to the test dataset for comparison.
Save Results:

Exports the results (actual vs. predicted prices) to a CSV file.
Example Output
The results dataframe will look like this:

date	symbol	adjusted	predicted_adjusted
2024-11-01	META	320.45	322.10
2024-11-02	META	325.12	326.78
2024-11-03	META	328.34	330.50
...	...	...	...
Visualization (Optional)
You can visualize the predicted vs. actual prices for better insights:

R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(results, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = adjusted, color = "Actual")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_adjusted, color = "Predicted")) +
  labs(title = "Predicted vs. Actual Prices (December 2024)", y = "Price", x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red"))
Next Steps
Review Results: Analyze how well the model performed by comparing predicted and actual values.
Evaluate Metrics: Calculate RMSE or MAPE to quantify prediction accuracy.
Adjust Model (Optional): If predictions are inaccurate, consider tuning the model or adding more features.
Let me know if you need help with evaluation metrics or further refinements!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error suggests that X_test, xgb_models, or both contain non-numeric values or invalid data types. Here's a step-by-step debugging and resolution process:

1. Check X_test
Ensure that X_test is a numeric matrix.

R
Copy code
str(X_test)
head(X_test)
If X_test contains non-numeric columns, remove or convert them:

R
Copy code
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%
  as.matrix()
Verify again:

R
Copy code
any(is.na(X_test))  # Ensure no missing values
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
2. Check xgb_models
Ensure xgb_models is a valid trained XGBoost model.

R
Copy code
xgb_models
If xgb_models is not loaded correctly, load it using:

R
Copy code
xgb_models <- xgb.load("faang_model.xgb")
If the file is missing or corrupted, retrain the model.

3. Debug the predict() Function
The error may arise if predict() is supplied invalid arguments. Ensure:

xgb_models is a trained XGBoost model.
X_test is a numeric matrix.
Debug step-by-step:

R
Copy code
# Check if the model and data are valid
inherits(xgb_models, "xgb.Booster")  # Should return TRUE
is.matrix(X_test)                    # Should return TRUE

# Test prediction on a small subset of X_test
predict(xgb_models, X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])
4. Updated Prediction Script
Here’s a corrected prediction script assuming xgb_models and X_test are valid:

R
Copy code
# Ensure X_test is a numeric matrix
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Ensure the model is correctly loaded
xgb_models <- xgb.load("faang_model.xgb")

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save Results
write.csv(results, "faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
5. Verify Results
After running the updated script:

Check the structure of results:

R
Copy code
str(results)
head(results)
Validate the predictions:

R
Copy code
any(is.na(results$predicted_adjusted))  # Ensure no NA values
Potential Issues
If issues persist:

Recheck Training and Testing Pipeline: Ensure features and preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, missing value handling) are consistent across training and testing.

Model Incompatibility: Confirm the trained model is compatible with the test dataset structure. Features in X_train and X_test should align exactly.

The issue remains because X_test contains the symbol column and all other columns are being treated as character strings rather than numeric values. To fix this:

Steps to Correct the Issue
Exclude Non-Numeric Columns:

The symbol column is non-numeric and should be excluded.
Convert Character Columns to Numeric:

Ensure all columns in X_test are numeric.
Updated Script
R
Copy code
# Ensure test data does not include non-numeric columns and convert to numeric matrix
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude 'symbol'
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert to numeric
  as.matrix()

# Check structure to ensure correctness
str(X_test)
Explanation of Fixes
Exclude Non-Numeric Columns:

Use select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) to exclude symbol.
Convert to Numeric:

Use mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) to handle character-to-numeric conversion properly, especially if values contain whitespace or formatting issues.
Ensure a Matrix:

Use as.matrix() to create a proper numeric matrix required by xgboost.
Verify Before Prediction
After running the updated script, verify:

The structure of X_test:

R
Copy code
str(X_test)
It should show a numeric matrix.
No missing or invalid values:

R
Copy code
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
Prediction Script
Once X_test is corrected, you can proceed with predictions.

R
Copy code
# Ensure the model is correctly loaded
xgb_models <- xgb.load("faang_model.xgb")

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results
write.csv(results, "faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Final Check
Confirm the results dataframe contains both actual and predicted values for comparison.
Use visualization or evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
If you encounter any further issues, let me know!

The issue persists because the symbol column is still included, and all columns are stored as character data. You need to ensure that only numeric columns are selected and converted into a proper numeric matrix.

Corrected Script
Here is an updated script that explicitly excludes the symbol column and ensures numeric conversion for the remaining columns:

R
Copy code
# Remove non-numeric columns and convert to numeric matrix
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude non-numeric columns like 'symbol'
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert to numeric
  as.matrix()

# Verify the structure of X_test
str(X_test)

# Check for any issues in X_test
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
Explanation of Fixes
Exclude symbol:

The symbol column is non-numeric and irrelevant for modeling. Use select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) to exclude it.
Convert Character to Numeric:

Use mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) to handle potential character formatting issues (e.g., extra spaces).
Convert to Matrix:

as.matrix() ensures the features are formatted as a numeric matrix required by XGBoost.
Debugging and Verification
After the update:

Check Structure:

R
Copy code
str(X_test)
Should show a numeric matrix with no character data.
Check for Missing Values:

R
Copy code
any(is.na(X_test))
Should return FALSE.
Check Data Type:

R
Copy code
is.numeric(X_test)
Should return TRUE.
Prediction Script
Once the feature matrix is corrected, you can use it for predictions:

R
Copy code
# Load the trained XGBoost model
xgb_models <- xgb.load("faang_model.xgb")

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results to CSV
write.csv(results, "faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Expected Outcome
results will contain columns for date, symbol, adjusted (actual prices), and predicted_adjusted (predicted prices).
If the issue persists, let me know so we can debug further!

The issue persists because X_test is still being treated as a character matrix, not a numeric matrix. This can happen if:

Non-numeric columns like symbol are included.
Numeric columns contain character formatting (e.g., spaces, special characters).
Let’s fix this systematically:

1. Confirm Column Selection
Ensure that only the numeric columns (sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) are selected. Explicitly exclude symbol.

R
Copy code
# Exclude non-numeric columns
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return)
2. Convert All Columns to Numeric
Convert all columns to numeric values. This ensures no formatting issues remain.

R
Copy code
# Convert all selected columns to numeric
X_test <- X_test %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.))))
3. Convert to a Numeric Matrix
After confirming all data is numeric, convert it into a matrix.

R
Copy code
# Convert to numeric matrix
X_test <- as.matrix(X_test)
4. Verify the Conversion
Check the structure of X_test to ensure it is now a numeric matrix.

R
Copy code
# Check structure
str(X_test)

# Confirm it's a numeric matrix
is.matrix(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
Final Prediction Script
Once X_test is corrected, proceed with predictions:

R
Copy code
# Load the trained model
xgb_models <- xgb.load("faang_model.xgb")

# Predict
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results
write.csv(results, "faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Potential Debugging Checkpoints
If the issue persists:

Verify Column Names:

R
Copy code
colnames(test)
Confirm sma_20, sma_50, volatility, and daily_return exist.
Ensure No Extra Characters:

Check if numeric columns contain non-numeric values like spaces or commas:
R
Copy code
unique(test$sma_20)
Re-run the Conversion: If issues persist, forcefully remove invalid data and re-run the conversion:

R
Copy code
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(gsub("[^0-9.-]", "", .))))) %>%
  as.matrix()

Adding missing grouping variables: symbol

it does this but non-numeric values are not allowed in xgboost
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue persists because the dataset train is still grouped by symbol, causing symbol to implicitly reappear in the select() operation. This inclusion of symbol (a non-numeric column) results in the error. To fix this:

Steps to Resolve
Ungroup the Data:

Before selecting the features, ensure that train is ungrouped.
R
Copy code
train <- train %>% ungroup()
Exclude Non-Numeric Columns:

Ensure symbol and other non-numeric columns are excluded explicitly.
Convert Remaining Columns to Numeric:

Ensure all selected columns are numeric.
Updated Script
Here’s the corrected script to prepare X_train:

R
Copy code
# Ensure the data is ungrouped
train <- train %>% ungroup()

# Prepare training features (numeric matrix)
X_train <- train %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude non-numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert to numeric
  as.matrix()

# Prepare training labels (numeric vector)
y_train <- as.numeric(train$adjusted)

# Verify the structure
str(X_train)
Key Checks
Grouping Issue:

Ensure train is ungrouped. Use:
R
Copy code
train <- train %>% ungroup()
Validate Columns:

Check the structure of train to ensure the correct columns are selected:
R
Copy code
colnames(train)
Ensure Numeric Conversion:

Convert all columns in X_train to numeric.
Verify X_train:

R
Copy code
is.matrix(X_train)  # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_train)  # Should return TRUE
any(is.na(X_train))  # Should return FALSE
If Issues Persist
If symbol still causes issues:

Explicitly remove it:

R
Copy code
train <- train %>% select(-symbol)
Debug the grouping issue:

R
Copy code
is_grouped_df(train)  # Should return FALSE
Let me know if further issues arise!

Script Details
Load Trained Model:

readRDS() is used to load the trained XGBoost model saved as xgb_models.rds.
Load and Filter Data:

The analysis_data.parquet file is read using arrow::read_parquet().
Data for November and December 2024 is filtered (filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31"))).
Prepare Features for Testing:

Only numeric columns (sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) are selected.
Columns are converted to numeric and converted into a matrix using as.matrix().
Make Predictions:

predict() is used with the trained model and X_test.
Combine Predictions with Actual Data:

Actual (adjusted) and predicted values are combined into the results dataframe.
Save Results:

Results are saved as a CSV file in data/03-results/.
Visualization (Optional):

A ggplot2 line plot compares actual and predicted stock prices for December 2024.
Expected Output
The resulting results dataframe will have the following structure:

date	symbol	adjusted	predicted_adjusted
2024-11-01	META	320.45	322.10
2024-11-02	META	325.12	326.78
2024-11-03	META	328.34	330.50
...	...	...	...
Next Steps
Validate Predictions:

Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, or MAPE to evaluate the model's performance.
Example:
R
Copy code
library(Metrics)
rmse(results$adjusted, results$predicted_adjusted)
mae(results$adjusted, results$predicted_adjusted)
Fine-Tune the Model (Optional):

If predictions are not accurate, revisit feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning.
Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

The error indicates that X_test contains non-numeric or improperly formatted data, which is causing the predict() function to fail. Let’s systematically debug and resolve the issue.

Steps to Resolve
Verify X_test

Check the structure of X_test to confirm it is a numeric matrix:
R
Copy code
str(X_test)
is.matrix(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
Ensure Only Numeric Columns

Exclude any non-numeric columns during the preparation of X_test:
R
Copy code
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude non-numeric columns like 'symbol'
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert to numeric
  as.matrix()
Debugging Data Values

Check the values in sma_20, sma_50, volatility, and daily_return to ensure they are numeric:

R
Copy code
lapply(test %>% select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), unique)
If any columns contain non-numeric data (e.g., spaces, special characters), clean them:

R
Copy code
test <- test %>%
  mutate(across(c(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), ~ as.numeric(as.character(gsub("[^0-9.-]", "", .)))))
Check Consistency of Features

Verify that the columns used in X_test during prediction are the same as those used for X_train during model training.
Updated Prediction Script
Here’s a refined prediction script with added checks:

R
Copy code
# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude non-numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Ensure all are numeric
  as.matrix()

# Verify the structure and values of X_test
str(X_test)  # Should show a numeric matrix
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results as CSV
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Common Issues
Non-Numeric Data in X_test:

Columns like sma_20, sma_50, volatility, or daily_return might contain characters or formatted strings.
Use mutate(across(...)) with as.numeric() and as.character() to fix this.
NA Values in X_test:

If any missing values exist, handle them before prediction:
R
Copy code
X_test <- na.omit(X_test)
Mismatch Between Training and Testing Features:

Ensure the features used in training (sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) are identical during testing.
Final Checks
Validate that the structure of X_test matches the trained model's expectations.
Ensure no NA values, special characters, or non-numeric data exist in X_test.
If the error persists, please share the structure and a small sample of your test data for further debugging.

The issue persists because the symbol column (a non-numeric column) is included in X_test, even though it shouldn't be. This is why X_test is not being treated as fully numeric. Here’s how to resolve the issue step by step:

Steps to Fix
Exclude Non-Numeric Columns

When creating X_test, ensure the symbol column is explicitly excluded.
Use select() to specify only numeric columns.
Convert Remaining Columns to Numeric

Use mutate(across(...)) to ensure all columns in X_test are numeric.
Updated Code for X_test
R
Copy code
# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude non-numeric columns like 'symbol'
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert all to numeric
  as.matrix()

# Verify the structure and type of X_test
str(X_test)  # Should show a numeric matrix
is.matrix(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
Full Updated Prediction Script
R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(xgboost)
library(dplyr)

# Load the trained XGBoost model
xgb_models <- readRDS("models/xgb_models.rds")

# Load and filter test data
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31"))  # November and December 2024 data

# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude 'symbol' and non-numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Ensure all are numeric
  as.matrix()

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results as CSV
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Expected Outputs
Structure of X_test:

Should show a numeric matrix:
R
Copy code
chr [1:120, 4] "sma_20" "sma_50" "volatility" "daily_return"
Predictions Saved in CSV:

faang_predictions_december_2024.csv will contain:
date	symbol	adjusted	predicted_adjusted
2024-11-01	META	320.45	322.10
2024-11-02	META	325.12	326.78
...	...	...	...
Visualization (Optional):

Use ggplot2 to visualize predicted vs. actual prices.
Debugging Tips
If the problem persists:

Verify Columns in test:

R
Copy code
colnames(test)
Ensure only numeric columns are selected.
Check for Extra Characters:

R
Copy code
lapply(test %>% select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), unique)
Remove unwanted characters using gsub() if necessary.
Ensure Consistency:

Ensure the features used during training (X_train) match those in X_test.

how to troubleshoot
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA indicates that X_test contains non-numeric data or has a structure incompatible with the xgboost model's expectations. Here's how to systematically troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

Step 1: Check the Structure of X_test
Ensure X_test is a numeric matrix and has no non-numeric values.

R
Copy code
# Check structure
str(X_test)

# Check if it's a matrix
is.matrix(X_test)  # Should return TRUE

# Check if all elements are numeric
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE

# Check for missing (NA) values
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
Step 2: Verify Column Selection
Ensure only numeric columns are included in X_test. If non-numeric columns are present (e.g., symbol), exclude them explicitly.

R
Copy code
# Exclude non-numeric columns and prepare numeric matrix
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Adjust column names as needed
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Ensure all are numeric
  as.matrix()
Step 3: Debug Data Issues
a) Check Data Types of Columns:
R
Copy code
sapply(test %>% select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), class)
Ensure all columns are numeric.
b) Check Unique Values:
R
Copy code
lapply(test %>% select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), unique)
Look for unexpected characters or strings (e.g., NA, " ").
c) Handle Invalid Characters:
If any non-numeric characters exist, clean the data:

R
Copy code
test <- test %>%
  mutate(across(c(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), ~ as.numeric(as.character(gsub("[^0-9.-]", "", .)))))
Step 4: Ensure Compatibility with Trained Model
a) Check Feature Names:
Verify that the columns used in X_test match those used in training (X_train).

R
Copy code
colnames(X_train) == colnames(X_test)  # Should return TRUE for all
b) Check Dimensions:
Ensure the number of features in X_test matches the trained model’s expectations.

R
Copy code
dim(X_test)
Step 5: Test Predictions on a Small Subset
If the issue persists, test a subset of X_test to pinpoint the problem.

R
Copy code
# Test predictions on a small subset
predictions_subset <- predict(xgb_models, X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])
Step 6: Print Debugging Information
If errors persist, print X_test to identify problematic rows or columns.

R
Copy code
# Print a small portion of X_test
head(X_test)
Common Causes and Fixes
Non-Numeric Values:

Fix: Use mutate(across(..., as.numeric)) after cleaning columns.
Mismatched Features:

Fix: Verify training and testing column names with colnames().
NA Values:

Fix: Remove or impute missing values in X_test:
R
Copy code
X_test <- na.omit(X_test)
Matrix Conversion Issue:

Fix: Explicitly convert X_test to a matrix:
R
Copy code
X_test <- as.matrix(X_test)
Final Prediction Code
Here’s the complete script incorporating fixes:

R
Copy code
# Ensure numeric matrix for X_test
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude non-numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert to numeric
  as.matrix()

# Verify structure and dimensions
str(X_test)
is.matrix(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE

# Predict using trained XGBoost model
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
If the Problem Persists
Share the output of:
R
Copy code
str(X_test)
head(X_test)
Confirm the dimensions of X_test and X_train:
R
Copy code
dim(X_test)
dim(X_train)
This will help narrow down the issue further. Let me know if additional help is needed!

The str(X_test) output indicates that X_test is still not a numeric matrix, as it contains the symbol column, which is a character column. This prevents the xgboost model from functioning correctly. Here's how to fix this issue.

Steps to Fix X_test
Exclude Non-Numeric Columns

Remove the symbol column explicitly from X_test.
Convert All Remaining Columns to Numeric

Ensure that all columns in X_test are numeric.
Verify the Structure

Confirm that X_test is a numeric matrix with no non-numeric data.
Corrected Code for X_test Preparation
R
Copy code
# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Select only numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert to numeric
  as.matrix()

# Verify the structure and type of X_test
str(X_test)  # Should show a numeric matrix
is.matrix(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
Full Prediction Script
Here’s the full script, including the corrected preparation for X_test:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(xgboost)
library(dplyr)

# Load the trained XGBoost model
xgb_models <- readRDS("models/xgb_models.rds")

# Load and filter test data
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31"))  # November and December 2024 data

# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Exclude 'symbol' and non-numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Ensure all are numeric
  as.matrix()

# Verify structure of X_test
str(X_test)  # Should confirm it's a numeric matrix

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results as CSV
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Debugging Output
After running the script:

Check str(X_test):

It should display a numeric matrix.
Example:
R
Copy code
num [1:120, 1:4] 580.4 579.2 578.2 577.3 577.7 ...
Check for non-numeric values:

R
Copy code
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
Confirm X_test dimensions:

R
Copy code
dim(X_test)
Why This Works
By explicitly selecting and converting the numeric columns (sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), the symbol column is excluded, and any formatting issues (e.g., extra spaces) are resolved.
This ensures X_test meets the xgboost model’s requirement for a fully numeric matrix.

If the same issue persists, let’s break down the problem and address it step-by-step to ensure a proper fix. The root cause is that X_test still contains non-numeric data or includes a column like symbol. Here’s how to resolve it systematically.

1. Start with the Structure of test
Let’s inspect the test dataset directly to ensure that only the expected numeric columns are included:

R
Copy code
# Check the structure of `test`
str(test)

# Check column names to confirm what is included
colnames(test)

# Preview the data to see actual values
head(test)
2. Explicitly Remove Non-Numeric Columns
Exclude any non-numeric columns (like symbol or date) explicitly when creating X_test:

R
Copy code
# Remove non-numeric columns explicitly
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Only include numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert to numeric
  as.matrix()
3. Debug Data for Non-Numeric Issues
Check if Columns Contain Non-Numeric Values:
Inspect the problematic columns (sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) for unexpected non-numeric values:

R
Copy code
# Check unique values in each column
lapply(test %>% select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), unique)
Handle Special Characters or Formatting:
If any column contains special characters, spaces, or unexpected strings, clean the data:

R
Copy code
# Clean and convert columns to numeric
test <- test %>%
  mutate(across(c(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return), ~ as.numeric(as.character(gsub("[^0-9.-]", "", .)))))
4. Confirm the Structure of X_test
After preparing X_test, confirm its structure:

R
Copy code
# Verify that X_test is numeric
str(X_test)       # Should show a numeric matrix
is.matrix(X_test) # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_test) # Should return TRUE
any(is.na(X_test)) # Should return FALSE
5. Test on a Small Subset
Try using a subset of X_test to verify that predictions work correctly:

R
Copy code
# Test predictions on a small subset
predictions_subset <- predict(xgb_models, X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])
6. Full Updated Prediction Script
Here’s the full script, incorporating all fixes:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(xgboost)
library(dplyr)

# Load the trained XGBoost model
xgb_models <- readRDS("models/xgb_models.rds")

# Load and filter test data
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31"))  # Filter for November and December 2024 data

# Explicitly prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Select only numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(gsub("[^0-9.-]", "", .))))) %>%  # Clean and convert to numeric
  as.matrix()

# Verify structure of X_test
str(X_test)  # Ensure it is a numeric matrix

# Predict with the trained model
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results to CSV
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
7. If Issues Persist
If the issue still persists:

Check the Training Data:

Verify that the training data (X_train) has the same structure as X_test.
R
Copy code
colnames(X_train) == colnames(X_test)
Debug with Minimal Data:

Test the script with only one numeric column to isolate the issue:
R
Copy code
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20) %>%  # Use a single numeric column
  mutate(sma_20 = as.numeric(as.character(sma_20))) %>%
  as.matrix()
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)
Share a Sample of Your Data:

If debugging fails, provide the structure and a small sample of the test data for further analysis:
R
Copy code
dput(head(test))

i think issue is arising because of symbol
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're correct! The symbol column is causing the issue because it's a non-numeric column, and xgboost requires X_test to be purely numeric. Additionally, the test dataset is still grouped by symbol, which can introduce implicit grouping behavior during operations. Let’s fix this comprehensively.

Step-by-Step Fix
Ungroup the Data:

Ungroup test to remove any grouping artifacts from the symbol column.
R
Copy code
test <- test %>% ungroup()
Exclude Non-Numeric Columns:

Explicitly remove the symbol and other non-numeric columns (e.g., date, month, day_of_week).
R
Copy code
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return)  # Select only numeric features
Convert All Columns to Numeric:

Ensure all columns are converted to numeric format to handle any residual formatting issues.
R
Copy code
X_test <- X_test %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Convert all to numeric
  as.matrix()
Updated Full Prediction Script
R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(xgboost)
library(dplyr)

# Load the trained XGBoost model
xgb_models <- readRDS("models/xgb_models.rds")

# Load and filter test data
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31"))  # Filter for November and December 2024 data

# Ensure the test data is ungrouped
test <- test %>% ungroup()

# Prepare numeric testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Select only numeric columns
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(as.character(.)))) %>%  # Ensure all are numeric
  as.matrix()

# Verify structure of X_test
str(X_test)  # Confirm it is a numeric matrix

# Predict with the trained model
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results to CSV
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Key Debugging Checks
After running the script:

Check the Structure of X_test:

Should now be a numeric matrix:
R
Copy code
str(X_test)
Check Dimensions of X_test:

Confirm it has the expected dimensions:
R
Copy code
dim(X_test)
Verify No Missing or Non-Numeric Data:

Ensure no NA values or invalid data:
R
Copy code
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
Expected Output
The results dataframe will contain:

date	symbol	adjusted	predicted_adjusted
2024-11-01	META	567.45	570.12
2024-11-02	META	561.12	565.78
2024-11-03	META	572.34	573.90
...	...	...	...

Warning: argument is not numeric or logical: returning NAError in x - fits : non-numeric argument to binary operator
ChatGPT said:

The persistent issue suggests that X_test is still not formatted correctly for the xgboost model. Let’s address this systematically by validating every step and isolating potential causes.

Root Cause Analysis
The error indicates that X_test contains non-numeric data, incompatible structure, or features that do not match the trained model.

Full Debugging Workflow
1. Ensure Test Data is Ungrouped
The test data is grouped by symbol. Ungroup it to prevent implicit grouping:

R
Copy code
test <- test %>% ungroup()
2. Exclude Non-Numeric Columns
Exclude any non-numeric columns explicitly:

R
Copy code
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Keep only numeric features





You said:
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

ChatGPT said:

From the debugging information:

Both X_train and X_test are numeric matrices with the same columns (sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return).
The structure seems correct, yet the prediction fails with the error: argument is not numeric or logical.
This suggests an incompatibility between the trained model (xgb_models) and the test matrix (X_test). Likely causes include:

Feature Scaling Mismatch:

The scale of features in X_test differs significantly from those in X_train due to preprocessing differences.
Model Training Issues:

The model might have been trained on improperly formatted data or with grouping artifacts.
Column Order/Name Issues:

The column order or names in X_test and X_train may not align, despite appearing correct.
Other Structural Issues:

Implicit grouping or unexpected matrix attributes.
Step-by-Step Fix
1. Verify Consistency of Feature Scaling
Check the range of values in X_train and X_test:

R
Copy code
summary(X_train)
summary(X_test)
If the ranges differ significantly, normalize X_test to match X_train (e.g., using Z-scores or Min-Max scaling):

R
Copy code
# Normalize X_test to match X_train (if needed)
X_test <- scale(X_test, center = colMeans(X_train), scale = apply(X_train, 2, sd))
2. Re-Train the Model
If inconsistencies are found in X_train during model training, retrain the model:

R
Copy code
# Retrain model using correctly formatted X_train and y_train
xgb_models <- xgboost(
  data = xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train),
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.3,
  nrounds = 100,
  verbose = 0
)

# Save the retrained model
saveRDS(xgb_models, "models/xgb_models_retrained.rds")
3. Test Predictions on Small Subset
To isolate issues, test predictions on a small subset of X_test:

R
Copy code
# Predict using the first 10 rows
predictions_subset <- predict(xgb_models, X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])
If this works, the problem is likely related to the full matrix structure or values.

4. Debug Feature Matching
Ensure column names and orders in X_train and X_test are identical:

R
Copy code
colnames(X_train) == colnames(X_test)  # Should return TRUE for all
If column names or orders differ, adjust X_test to match X_train:

R
Copy code
X_test <- X_test[, colnames(X_train)]
Updated Prediction Script
Here’s the corrected full script:

R
Copy code
# Ensure test data is ungrouped
test <- test %>% ungroup()

# Prepare numeric testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Keep only numeric features
  as.matrix()

# Verify feature alignment
if (!all(colnames(X_train) == colnames(X_test))) {
  X_test <- X_test[, colnames(X_train), drop = FALSE]  # Align column order with X_train
}

# Normalize X_test (if needed)
X_test <- scale(X_test, center = colMeans(X_train), scale = apply(X_train, 2, sd))

# Predict with the trained model
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data for comparison
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Validation Checklist
Column Alignment:

Verify colnames(X_train) == colnames(X_test) returns TRUE.
Numeric Structure:

Confirm is.numeric(X_test) returns TRUE.
Prediction Test:

Test with a small subset of X_test using:
R
Copy code
predict(xgb_models, X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])
If the issue persists, please:

Share the output of:
R
Copy code

The issue arises because the scales and distributions of features in X_test differ significantly from those in X_train. This is evident from the difference in the Mean, Min, Max, and other summary statistics. For example:

Mean of volatility: 29.92 (X_train) vs. 66.83 (X_test).
Mean of daily_return: 0.0011 (X_train) vs. 0.0033 (X_test).
Such discrepancies can lead to incompatible predictions in xgboost.

Solution: Normalize X_test to Match X_train
To address this issue, normalize X_test using the means and standard deviations from X_train. This ensures X_test is scaled to the same range as the training data.

Updated Script for Normalization
R
Copy code
# Normalize X_test to match X_train
X_test <- scale(
  X_test,
  center = colMeans(X_train),   # Center using means of X_train
  scale = apply(X_train, 2, sd) # Scale using standard deviations of X_train
)

# Verify the structure of the normalized X_test
str(X_test)
summary(X_test)
Why This Works
The scale() function aligns the mean and variance of X_test with X_train.
After scaling:
The Mean of each column in X_test will approximately match 0.
The Variance of each column will approximately match 1, similar to X_train's scaled features.
Full Updated Prediction Script
Here’s the full script with normalization:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(xgboost)
library(dplyr)

# Load the trained XGBoost model
xgb_models <- readRDS("models/xgb_models.rds")

# Load and filter test data

# Ensure test data is ungrouped

# Prepare numeric testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Select numeric columns
  as.matrix()

# Normalize X_test to match X_train
X_test <- scale(
  X_test,

The persistent error indicates that there might still be an issue with the structure of X_test or a mismatch between the model (xgb_models) and the test matrix (X_test). Let’s methodically debug and resolve this.

Step-by-Step Debugging
1. Verify X_test After Scaling
After scaling, ensure X_test is still a numeric matrix.

R
Copy code
str(X_test)
is.matrix(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_test) # Should return TRUE
If either check fails, it suggests X_test may not be numeric or has an incompatible structure. In that case:

Explicitly ensure it is numeric after scaling:
R
Copy code
X_test <- as.matrix(X_test)
mode(X_test) <- "numeric"
2. Validate the Dimensions of X_test
The number of rows and columns in X_test must match the model’s expectations.

R
Copy code
dim(X_train)  # Compare this to the next line
dim(X_test)
If the number of columns differs:

Align X_test with X_train:
R
Copy code
X_test <- X_test[, colnames(X_train), drop = FALSE]
3. Test a Subset of X_test
To isolate the problem, try predicting a small subset of X_test.

R
Copy code
predictions_subset <- predict(xgb_models, X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])
If this works, the issue may lie with specific rows in X_test or its overall structure.

4. Check xgb_models Compatibility
Ensure the xgb_models object is valid and compatible with the test data.

R
Copy code
str(xgb_models)  # Ensure this is a trained XGBoost model
If the model was trained with unexpected artifacts (e.g., grouping or extra columns), retrain it to align with the test data.

5. Re-Train the Model
As a last resort, retrain the model using a clean dataset to ensure compatibility.

R
Copy code
# Re-train the model
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
xgb_models <- xgboost(
  data = dtrain,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.3,
  nrounds = 100,
  verbose = 0
)
saveRDS(xgb_models, "models/xgb_models_retrained.rds")
Updated Full Prediction Script
Here’s the revised prediction script after addressing potential issues:

R

# Load the trained XGBoost model
xgb_models <- readRDS("models/xgb_models.rds")

# Load and filter test data
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31")) %>%  # Filter for November and December 2024
  ungroup()

# Prepare numeric testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%  # Select numeric columns
  as.matrix()

# Ensure X_test is numeric and properly aligned
X_test <- scale(
  X_test,
  center = colMeans(X_train),
  scale = apply(X_train, 2, sd)
)
mode(X_test) <- "numeric"  # Ensure numeric mode

# Predict with the trained model

  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results to CSV
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results

Checklist for Final Debugging
Verify X_test:

Check its structure and ensure it is numeric:
R
Copy code
str(X_test)
is.numeric(X_test)
dim(X_test)
Test Compatibility:

The dimensions of X_train and X_test match in terms of the number of columns (4), which means the structure is compatible. Both matrices are numeric, so the xgboost model should accept X_test without issue. However, the error persists. Here's a targeted approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

Root Cause
The Warning: argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA often arises from:

Data issues in X_test: Hidden NA or Inf values.
Model compatibility: The xgb_models object might not align with the structure of X_test.
Internal corruption in the model object: The xgb_models file might be improperly loaded or trained.
Targeted Debugging and Fix
1. Check for NA or Inf Values in X_test
Even if is.numeric(X_test) returns TRUE, hidden NA or Inf values could cause the issue.

R
Copy code
any(is.na(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
any(is.infinite(X_test))  # Should return FALSE
If there are NA or Inf values, clean the data:

R
Copy code
X_test[is.na(X_test)] <- 0  # Replace NA with 0
X_test[is.infinite(X_test)] <- 0  # Replace Inf with 0
2. Test the Model Compatibility with a Small Subset
Test predictions on a subset of X_test to narrow down the issue:

R
Copy code
predictions_subset <- predict(xgb_models, X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])
If this works, the issue is likely related to specific rows in X_test.

3. Ensure xgb_models is Valid
Verify that xgb_models is a properly trained XGBoost model.

R
Copy code
str(xgb_models)  # Should show an XGBoost model structure
If the model seems invalid, retrain it to ensure alignment with the data:

R
Copy code
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
xgb_models <- xgboost(
  data = dtrain,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.3,
  nrounds = 100,
  verbose = 0
)
saveRDS(xgb_models, "models/xgb_models_retrained.rds")
4. Validate Column Order and Names
Confirm that the column order and names in X_train and X_test are identical:

R
Copy code
colnames(X_train) == colnames(X_test)  # Should return TRUE for all
If there’s a mismatch, align X_test with X_train:

R
Copy code
X_test <- X_test[, colnames(X_train), drop = FALSE]
5. Full Prediction Script
Here’s the updated prediction script incorporating all debugging steps:

R
Copy code
# Ensure X_test is numeric and properly formatted
X_test <- test %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Replace NA or Inf values
X_test[is.na(X_test)] <- 0
X_test[is.infinite(X_test)] <- 0

# Normalize X_test to match X_train
X_test <- scale(
  X_test,
  center = colMeans(X_train),
  scale = apply(X_train, 2, sd)
)

# Predict with the trained model
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results to CSV
write.csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# View results
head(results)
Expected Outcome
If the issue is fixed, predictions will no longer return an error, and you’ll get a results dataframe with predicted values.
Example:
date	symbol	adjusted	predicted_adjusted
2024-11-01	META	567.45	570.12
2024-11-02	META	561.12	565.78
If the Issue Persists
Please share:

The output of:
R
Copy code
any(is.na(X_test))
any(is.infinite(X_test))
colnames(X_train) == colnames(X_test)
The structure of xgb_models:
R
Copy code
str(xgb_models)

troubleshoot - fix model if necessary
ChatGPT said:

The persistent error suggests there may be a deeper issue with the model training or data preparation pipeline. To resolve this thoroughly, we need to:

Validate the X_train and y_train used during model training.
Confirm that xgb_models is a valid and compatible XGBoost model.
Ensure X_test matches the expectations of the trained model.
Re-train the model if necessary to ensure alignment.
Let’s systematically troubleshoot and address these issues.

Step 1: Validate X_train and y_train
Confirm that X_train and y_train used during model training are numeric, properly aligned, and do not contain NA or Inf.

R
Copy code
# Check `X_train`
str(X_train)
summary(X_train)
any(is.na(X_train))       # Should return FALSE
any(is.infinite(X_train)) # Should return FALSE

# Check `y_train`
summary(y_train)
any(is.na(y_train))       # Should return FALSE
any(is.infinite(y_train)) # Should return FALSE
Fix Issues in X_train or y_train
If issues are found:

Replace NA or Inf values in X_train:
R
Copy code
X_train[is.na(X_train)] <- 0
X_train[is.infinite(X_train)] <- 0
Ensure y_train is numeric:
R
Copy code
y_train <- as.numeric(y_train)
Step 2: Check xgb_models
Ensure that the model (xgb_models) is valid and compatible with the data.

R
Copy code
# Check the structure of the model
str(xgb_models)
If the model is invalid or corrupted, retrain it (see Step 4).

Step 3: Validate X_test
Ensure X_test aligns perfectly with X_train in terms of column order, names, and scaling.

R
Copy code
# Check `X_test`
str(X_test)
summary(X_test)
any(is.na(X_test))       # Should return FALSE
any(is.infinite(X_test)) # Should return FALSE

# Ensure column names and order match `X_train`
colnames(X_test) == colnames(X_train) # Should return TRUE for all
Fix Mismatches in X_test
If column names or orders differ, realign X_test:

R
Copy code
X_test <- X_test[, colnames(X_train), drop = FALSE]
Step 4: Re-Train the Model
If issues are found in xgb_models or the training pipeline, retrain the model to ensure alignment.

Re-Training Script
R
Copy code
# Prepare training data
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)

# Train the XGBoost model
xgb_models <- xgboost(
  data = dtrain,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.3,
  nrounds = 100,
  verbose = 0
)

# Save the re-trained model
saveRDS(xgb_models, "models/xgb_models_retrained.rds")
Step 5: Test Predictions
After confirming all components, test predictions on a small subset of X_test:

R
Copy code
# Test predictions on a small subset
predictions_subset <- predict(xgb_models, X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])

# If this works, proceed with full predictions
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)
Updated Full Script
Here’s the complete, corrected pipeline:

test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31")) %>%
  select(sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, date, symbol, adjusted)

# Prepare `X_train` and `y_train`

  as.matrix()
X_train[is.na(X_train)] <- 0
X_train[is.infinite(X_train)] <- 0

# Normalize `X_test` using `X_train` statistics
X_test <- scale(
  X_test,
  center = colMeans(X_train),
  scale = apply(X_train, 2, sd)
)

# Predict with the trained model
predictions <- predict(xgb_models, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data

Key Fixes
Ensured X_train, y_train, and X_test are numeric with no NA or Inf values.
Verified column alignment between X_train and X_test.
Re-trained the model to guarantee compatibility.

The issue arises because the xgb_models object indicates that you are training separate models for each stock (META, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL). The trained models expect specific features (Lag_1, NASDAQ_Lag_1, Smoothed_NASDAQ_Change, etc.), but your X_test only contains sma_20, sma_50, volatility, and daily_return.

The discrepancy in features is causing the error. Let’s address this systematically:

Key Issues
Feature Mismatch:

The models were trained on features like Lag_1, NASDAQ_Lag_1, Smoothed_NASDAQ_Change, and others.
Your X_test contains entirely different features: sma_20, sma_50, volatility, and daily_return.
Separate Models for Each Stock:

Each stock has its own trained model (xgb_models is a list of models for META, AMZN, etc.).
Predictions must be made separately for each stock using the corresponding model.
Steps to Fix
1. Verify Training Pipeline
Ensure that the features used during training match those intended for prediction. If Lag_1, NASDAQ_Lag_1, etc., were used during training, you must include them in your feature engineering process.

Update the data cleaning script to compute these features:

R
Copy code
# Compute lagged and rolling features
analysis_data <- raw_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    NASDAQ_Lag_1 = lag(adjusted * 0.98, 1),  # Example external feature
    Smoothed_NASDAQ_Change = rollmean(adjusted, 3, fill = NA),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  na.omit()  # Remove rows with NA
Save the cleaned data and ensure all features are present:

R
Copy code
write_parquet(analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")
2. Train Models for Each Stock
Train separate models for each stock using the updated feature set:

R
Copy code
# Train separate models for each stock
xgb_models <- analysis_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  group_map(~ {
    X_train <- .x %>%
      select(Lag_1, NASDAQ_Lag_1, Smoothed_NASDAQ_Change, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
      as.matrix()
    y_train <- as.numeric(.x$adjusted)

    dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
    xgb.train(
      params = list(objective = "reg:squarederror", eta = 0.1, max_depth = 6),
      data = dtrain,
      nrounds = 100,
      verbose = 0
    )
  })

# Save the models
saveRDS(xgb_models, "models/xgb_models.rds")
3. Predict for Each Stock
Use the correct model for each stock to make predictions.

R
Copy code
# Load models
xgb_models <- readRDS("models/xgb_models.rds")

# Predict for each stock
results <- analysis_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  group_map(~ {
    X_test <- .x %>%
      select(Lag_1, NASDAQ_Lag_1, Smoothed_NASDAQ_Change, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return) %>%
      as.matrix()

    # Ensure no NA or Inf in X_test
    X_test[is.na(X_test)] <- 0
    X_test[is.infinite(X_test)] <- 0

    predictions <- predict(xgb_models[[.y$symbol]]$Model, X_test)

    .x %>%
      mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
      select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)
  }) %>%
  bind_rows()

# Save results
write_csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv")

i want to create a unified model
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a unified model instead of separate models for each stock, we need to:

Combine Data from All Stocks:

Use a single training dataset with an additional symbol identifier as a feature.
Feature Engineering:

Create features that apply to all stocks (e.g., Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, etc.).
Train One Model:

Train a unified xgboost model using data from all stocks.
Predict for Each Stock:

Use the unified model to predict for each stock in the test set.
Steps for a Unified Model
1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Prepare the dataset with combined data and engineered features for all stocks.

2. Data Splitting
Split the data into training and testing sets.

R
Copy code
# Load cleaned data
analysis_data <- read_parquet("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Split into training and testing sets
train <- analysis_data %>%

test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31"))
3. Train the Unified Model
Train a single xgboost model using the combined training data.

R
Copy code
library(xgboost)

# Prepare training features (X_train) and labels (y_train)
X_train <- train %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()
y_train <- as.numeric(train$adjusted)

# Train the XGBoost model
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
xgb_model <- xgboost(
  data = dtrain,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.1,
  nrounds = 100,
  objective = "reg:squarederror",
  verbose = 0
)

# Save the unified model
saveRDS(xgb_model, "models/xgb_unified_model.rds")
4. Predict Using the Unified Model
Use the trained unified model to make predictions for the test set.

R
Copy code
# Load the unified model
xgb_model <- readRDS("models/xgb_unified_model.rds")

# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Predict
predictions <- predict(xgb_model, X_test)

# Combine predictions with actual data
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results
write_csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv")

# View results
head(results)
Advantages of a Unified Model
Simplifies Maintenance:

One model handles all stocks, reducing complexity.
Leverages Shared Patterns:

The model can capture shared trends across different stocks.
Easier Deployment:

Only one model is deployed, regardless of the number of stocks.
Expected Output
The results file will include predictions for all stocks:

date	symbol	adjusted	predicted_adjusted
2024-11-01	META	567.45	570.12
2024-11-02	AMZN	561.12	565.78
2024-11-03	AAPL	572.34	573.90
...	...	...	...
Next Steps
Validate Predictions:

Use metrics like RMSE or MAE to evaluate the model's performance.
R
Copy code
library(Metrics)
rmse(test$adjusted, results$predicted_adjusted)
Optimize Hyperparameters:

Use tools like caret or mlr3 for hyperparameter tuning.

Here’s a script to visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices for the FAANG stocks. The script uses ggplot2 to create clear and informative plots.

Visualization Script
R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load prediction results
results <- read.csv("data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv")

# Line Plot: Predicted vs. Actual for Each Stock
ggplot(results, aes(x = as.Date(date))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = adjusted, color = "Actual"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_adjusted, color = "Predicted"), linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~symbol, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs. Actual Stock Prices (December 2024)",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Stock Price",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red")) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

# Save the plot
ggsave("data/03-results/faang_predicted_vs_actual.png", width = 12, height = 8)
How This Works
Line Plot:

Plots adjusted (actual prices) and predicted_adjusted (predicted prices) on the same graph.
Each stock is displayed in a separate facet using facet_wrap.
Free Y-Axis:

scales = "free_y" ensures that each stock has its own y-axis scale, as stock prices may differ significantly across stocks.
Custom Colors:

Uses blue for actual prices and red for predicted prices.
Dashing Predicted Line:

Differentiates predicted values with a dashed line.
Expected Output
The plot will have:

Facets: One for each stock (META, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL).
Lines:
Solid blue for actual prices.
Dashed red for predicted prices.
Customization Options
Focus on a Specific Stock: To visualize only one stock:

R
Copy code
ggplot(results %>% filter(symbol == "META"), aes(x = as.Date(date))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = adjusted, color = "Actual"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_adjusted, color = "Predicted"), linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs. Actual Stock Prices for META (December 2024)",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Stock Price",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red"))
Change Line Types/Colors: Adjust linetype and scale_color_manual as needed for clarity.

why is it showing ^IXIC?


ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The presence of ^IXIC (likely representing the NASDAQ composite index) in your plot indicates that it was included in your dataset as one of the symbols. If this was unintended, it might have been included during the data downloading or data preparation phase. Here's how to debug and resolve this:

Steps to Fix
1. Check Your Data
Inspect the dataset used to generate the visualization and verify if ^IXIC is included in the symbol column.

R
Copy code
# Check the unique symbols in the dataset
unique(results$symbol)
If ^IXIC appears, it was included during data collection or preparation.

2. Filter Out ^IXIC
If ^IXIC is not part of your analysis, filter it out before visualization.

R
Copy code
# Filter out ^IXIC
results <- results %>%
  filter(symbol != "^IXIC")
3. Check Data Downloading
If ^IXIC appears during the data downloading step, it might have been included unintentionally. Double-check the tickers used when fetching data. If you're using:

R
Copy code
faang_tickers <- c("META", "AMZN", "AAPL", "NFLX", "GOOGL", "^IXIC")
Remove ^IXIC from the list:

R
Copy code
faang_tickers <- c("META", "AMZN", "AAPL", "NFLX", "GOOGL")
4. Check Data Cleaning
If you merged additional market data (e.g., NASDAQ index) during feature engineering, ensure it is excluded from the final dataset used for predictions:

R
Copy code
# Exclude ^IXIC during data preparation
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(symbol != "^IXIC")
5. Recreate the Visualization
After ensuring ^IXIC is excluded, regenerate the visualization:

R
Copy code
ggplot(results, aes(x = as.Date(date))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = adjusted, color = "Actual"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_adjusted, color = "Predicted"), linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~symbol, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs. Actual Stock Prices (December 2024)",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Stock Price",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
Optional: Include ^IXIC If Relevant
If ^IXIC was intentionally included as a benchmark index, consider separating it from individual stock analyses or visualizing it in a dedicated plot.

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional adjustments!

why is it predicitng prices for november?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The model is predicting prices for November because the test data likely includes dates from November. This issue may have occurred during the data splitting step, where test data was incorrectly defined to include dates from November rather than December only.

Steps to Fix
1. Check Test Data Date Range
Inspect the test dataset to confirm its date range:

R
Copy code
# Check the date range of the test set
range(test$date)

# Alternatively, view unique months in the test set
unique(lubridate::month(test$date, label = TRUE))
If the test dataset includes November dates, adjust the filter during the splitting process.

2. Correct Data Splitting
Ensure that the test dataset includes only December 2024 data:

R
Copy code
# Split the data correctly
train <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) < as.Date("2024-12-01"))  # Up to November 30, 2024

test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01"))  # Only December 2024
3. Re-Train and Re-Predict
After splitting the data correctly, re-train the model and make predictions for December 2024:

R
Copy code
# Re-train model (if necessary)
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(
  data = train %>%
    select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
    as.matrix(),
  label = train$adjusted
)
xgb_model <- xgboost(
  data = dtrain,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.1,
  nrounds = 100,
  objective = "reg:squarederror",
  verbose = 0
)

# Re-predict for December 2024
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()
predictions <- predict(xgb_model, X_test)

# Update test results
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)

# Save results
write_csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv")
4. Update Visualization
Regenerate the plot with the corrected predictions for December 2024:

R
Copy code
# Filter results for December 2024 only
results_december <- results %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01"))

# Plot
ggplot(results_december, aes(x = as.Date(date))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = adjusted, color = "Actual"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_adjusted, color = "Predicted"), linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~symbol, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs. Actual Stock Prices (December 2024)",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Stock Price",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
Why This Happens
Incorrect Data Splitting:
If the test set includes dates before December 1, 2024, the model will predict for those earlier dates.
Feature Overlap:
Without properly defining the test set, you might unintentionally predict for dates already present in the training set.
Expected Fix
After applying the corrected filter for December 2024, the model will:

Train on data up to November 30, 2024.
Predict for December 2024 only.
The visualization will reflect this correction, showing predictions for December 2024 instead of November. Let me know if you need further clarification!

why is it predicting dates for november?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The model is predicting for November because of an issue in the data splitting step. Specifically, the test dataset is filtered to include all dates after October 31, 2024, which includes both November and December 2024. Here's the culprit in your code:

R
Copy code
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31"))
This filter includes November 1, 2024 through November 30, 2024, along with December data. If you only want to predict for December 2024, you need to refine the filtering logic.

Fix the Data Splitting
Replace the test filter with one that restricts the test data to December 2024 only:

R
Copy code
# Filter test data to include only December 2024
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))
Update the training set to ensure it stops at November 30, 2024:

R
Copy code
# Training data ends at November 30, 2024
train <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) < as.Date("2024-12-01"))
Why This Happens
Current Issue:
filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date("2024-10-31")) includes all data starting from November 1, 2024, including November and December.
Fixed Logic:
By specifying a range (2024-12-01 to 2024-12-31), only December 2024 is used for testing.
Updated Script
Here’s the updated script for data splitting and training:

R
Copy code
# Split into training and testing sets
train <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) < as.Date("2024-12-01"))  # Up to November 30, 2024

test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))  # Only December 2024
Re-Run the Workflow
Re-train the model using the updated train dataset.
Generate predictions for the updated test dataset.
Recreate the visualization using the corrected results.
Expected Outcome
After applying the fix:

The test dataset will only include December 2024.
The visualization will display predictions for December 2024 exclusively.

You said:
Error in xgb.DMatrix(newdata, missing = missing, nthread = NVL(nthread,  : 
  REAL() can only be applied to a 'numeric', not a 'logical

why is it giving this error now?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error REAL() can only be applied to a 'numeric', not a 'logical' occurs because the X_test matrix contains logical values (e.g., TRUE, FALSE) instead of numeric values. This typically happens if one or more columns in the dataset are not properly converted to numeric.

Steps to Fix
Verify the Structure of X_test Check the structure of X_test to identify any columns that might be logical or non-numeric.

R
Copy code
str(X_test)  # Check structure of the testing matrix
Look for any columns marked as logical. For example:

css
Copy code
num [1:100, 1:7] 0.01 0.02 0.03 ...
logi [1:100, 8] TRUE FALSE ...
If you find any logical columns, it means these need to be converted to numeric.

Force All Columns in X_test to be Numeric Before creating the xgb.DMatrix, ensure all columns in X_test are numeric:

R
Copy code
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.))) %>%  # Convert all columns to numeric
  as.matrix()
Key Notes:

mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.))) ensures every column is converted to numeric.
If the dataset has any non-numeric or logical columns, they will be properly coerced.
Check for Missing Values If the conversion introduces NA values (e.g., converting TRUE to numeric), remove or replace them:

R
Copy code
X_test[is.na(X_test)] <- 0  # Replace NA values with 0
Recreate the xgb.DMatrix Now, recreate the xgb.DMatrix with the corrected X_test:

R
Copy code
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test)
predictions <- predict(xgb_model, dtest)
Updated Prediction Script
R
Copy code
# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.))) %>%  # Convert all columns to numeric
  as.matrix()

# Replace NA values with 0 (if necessary)
X_test[is.na(X_test)] <- 0

# Predict using the trained model
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test)
predictions <- predict(xgb_model, dtest)

# Combine predictions with actual data
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)
Why This Works
Ensuring Numeric Data:
XGBoost only accepts numeric data; converting all columns in X_test ensures compatibility.
Handling Missing Values:
Replacing NA ensures the matrix doesn't break due to missing values.
Checking Logical Columns:
Logical columns (TRUE/FALSE) are coerced into 1/0, making them numeric.
Expected Outcome
After applying these fixes, the error will no longer occur, and predictions will proceed smoothly.

Let me know if you encounter further issues!

ChatGPT said:

You're correct: the filter() function in this context does not introduce logical columns directly, but it does ensure rows match the logical condition. However, no logical columns should be introduced into your dataset by this filter alone.

The actual issue is likely elsewhere in the data preparation pipeline, particularly during the X_test creation step. If there is still a logical column in X_test, it may come from unintended sources, such as:

Columns with Logical Values in analysis_data: Check if any columns in analysis_data contain logical values (e.g., TRUE or FALSE) before filtering.
Data Cleaning Steps: Some operations, such as comparisons or conditionals, might create logical values.
Debugging the Issue
To pinpoint the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check Structure of analysis_data
Before filtering, inspect the structure of analysis_data to identify any logical columns:

R
Copy code
str(analysis_data)
If there are any logical columns, convert them to numeric before proceeding.

2. Check Structure of test
After filtering, check the structure of test to ensure no logical columns were introduced:

R
Copy code
str(test)
3. Check X_test
After creating X_test, confirm that all columns are numeric:

R
Copy code
str(X_test)
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
If any columns are logical, they need to be converted to numeric.

Fixing the Issue
If you find logical columns in test or X_test, convert them to numeric explicitly:

R
Copy code
# Convert logical columns to numeric in `test`
test <- test %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ if (is.logical(.)) as.numeric(.) else .))

# Ensure `X_test` is numeric
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.))) %>%
  as.matrix()
Updated Workflow
Here's the corrected section of the code:

R
Copy code
# Split into testing set (December 2024)
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31")) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ if (is.logical(.)) as.numeric(.) else .))

# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.))) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Predict
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test)
predictions <- predict(xgb_model, dtest)

# Combine predictions with actual data
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)
Why This Works
Logical to Numeric Conversion:

Converts TRUE/FALSE values in logical columns to 1/0 for compatibility with numeric matrices.
Ensures Numeric Matrix:

Makes sure X_test is a numeric matrix required by xgb.DMatrix.
Validation:

Double-checks the structure of test and X_test to avoid runtime errors.
Next Steps
Run the updated script. If the issue persists:

Check the full structure of test and X_test using str().
Share the output of str(analysis_data) and str(test) for further debugging.
Let me know if this resolves the issue!

there are no logical columns
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If there are no logical columns in your data and you're still encountering the error REAL() can only be applied to a 'numeric', not a 'logical', it is likely caused by a subtle issue in data preparation, matrix creation, or a leftover attribute from a prior operation. Let’s thoroughly debug and resolve this.

Root Cause Analysis
Matrix Creation Issue:

The xgb.DMatrix() function requires that all elements in the input matrix are numeric.
Even if columns in the data frame are numeric, the conversion to a matrix might not handle factors, characters, or other attributes correctly.
Non-Numeric Values:

Hidden non-numeric values (e.g., NA, Inf) may not be obvious but can still disrupt the model input.
Attributes in the Data:

If the data frame has unexpected attributes (e.g., grouped_df from dplyr::group_by), these could persist and interfere with the xgb.DMatrix function.
Step-by-Step Debugging
1. Inspect the Structure of X_test
Run the following commands to confirm the structure and contents of X_test:

R
Copy code
str(X_test)  # Check structure
summary(X_test)  # Check summary statistics
any(is.na(X_test))  # Check for NA values
any(is.infinite(X_test))  # Check for Inf values
If any non-numeric values or unexpected attributes are present, they need to be handled.

2. Explicitly Coerce Columns to Numeric
Even if columns appear numeric, force all columns to be numeric before converting to a matrix:

R
Copy code
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.))) %>%  # Force numeric conversion
  as.matrix()
3. Check Matrix Properties
After creating X_test, verify that it is a valid numeric matrix:

R
Copy code
is.matrix(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
is.numeric(X_test) # Should return TRUE
4. Handle Missing or Infinite Values
Replace any NA or Inf values with a default (e.g., 0):

R
Copy code
X_test[is.na(X_test)] <- 0
X_test[is.infinite(X_test)] <- 0
5. Recreate the xgb.DMatrix
Once the matrix is confirmed to be numeric, recreate the xgb.DMatrix object:

R
Copy code
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test)
If the error persists, the issue might be with the model object or the training pipeline.

Updated Workflow
Here’s the corrected and debugged workflow:

R
Copy code
# Prepare testing features (X_test)
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.))) %>%  # Ensure numeric
  as.matrix()

# Replace NA or Inf values
X_test[is.na(X_test)] <- 0
X_test[is.infinite(X_test)] <- 0

# Check structure
str(X_test)
summary(X_test)

# Create xgb.DMatrix
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test)

# Predict
predictions <- predict(xgb_model, dtest)

# Combine predictions with actual data
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)
Alternative Debugging Approach
If the issue persists, it could stem from an issue with the model or training data.

Validate Model Input During Training: Check the training data (X_train) for any similar issues:

R
Copy code
str(X_train)
is.numeric(X_train)
Re-Train the Model: If the training data had issues, re-train the model after fixing the data.

Test with Minimal Data: Try predicting with a small subset of X_test to isolate the issue:

R
Copy code
dtest_subset <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test[1:10, , drop = FALSE])
predict(xgb_model, dtest_subset)
Likely Causes
A non-numeric value slipped into X_test or X_train despite appearing numeric.
The matrix conversion step introduced an issue (e.g., character or factor).
Hidden attributes in the test data frame caused problems during xgb.DMatrix creation.
By following the updated workflow, these issues should be resolved. Let me know if you encounter further challenges!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If is.matrix(X_test) returns TRUE but is.numeric(X_test) returns FALSE, this indicates that one or more elements in the matrix are not numeric. Let’s systematically find which column(s) are causing this issue.

Step-by-Step Debugging
1. Check the Structure of X_test
Inspect the structure of X_test to identify potential non-numeric columns or values:

R
Copy code
str(X_test)
Look for any columns marked as character or logical.
If all columns are listed as num, the issue might lie in the conversion process or unexpected non-numeric elements (e.g., factors, characters).
2. Check Column Types in the Source Data
Before creating X_test, check the column types in the test data frame:

R
Copy code
str(test)
Identify if any columns used in X_test (e.g., Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, etc.) are not numeric.
Fix any columns with types like character, factor, or logical by converting them to numeric.
3. Check for Non-Numeric Elements in Each Column
Iterate over each column in X_test to identify non-numeric elements:

R
Copy code
# Check each column for non-numeric values
non_numeric_columns <- sapply(X_test, function(col) !is.numeric(col))
non_numeric_columns
This will return a logical vector where TRUE indicates a column with non-numeric elements.

4. Identify and Fix the Problem Columns
If any column is not numeric, inspect its contents:

R
Copy code
# Example: Check the problematic column "Rolling_Mean_7"
unique(test$Rolling_Mean_7)
If the column contains non-numeric values (e.g., "NA", "TRUE", or "A"), fix it by converting to numeric:

R
Copy code
test <- test %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.)))  # Convert all columns to numeric
5. Debug Matrix Conversion
After confirming that all source columns are numeric, recreate X_test and recheck its properties:

R
Copy code
# Create matrix again
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Recheck matrix properties
str(X_test)
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should now return TRUE
Comprehensive Debugging Script
Here’s a complete script to debug and fix the issue:

R
Copy code
# Check column types in the source data
str(test)

# Ensure all columns are numeric
test <- test %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.)))  # Convert all columns to numeric

# Check for non-numeric elements in each column
non_numeric_columns <- sapply(test, function(col) any(!is.numeric(col)))
print(non_numeric_columns)  # Identify problematic columns

# Create X_test matrix
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Recheck matrix properties
str(X_test)
is.numeric(X_test)  # Should return TRUE
Expected Outcome
After running the script:

All columns in test and X_test will be numeric.
is.numeric(X_test) will return TRUE.
If the issue persists, share:

The output of str(test).
The logical vector returned by non_numeric_columns.

The issue here is that both test and X_test are empty. This happens because your filtering step for test is resulting in an empty dataset. Specifically:

R
Copy code
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))
It indicates that there are no rows in analysis_data for December 2024. This can happen if:

Your data only goes up to November 30, 2024.
The to parameter in tq_get() stops at November 30, 2024.
Feature engineering removed rows for December (e.g., due to na.omit()).
If lagged values (Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, etc.) rely on previous days, rows for early December may be dropped.
Steps to Fix
1. Verify the Data Range
Check the range of dates in analysis_data to confirm if December 2024 data exists:

R
Copy code
range(analysis_data$date)
unique(lubridate::month(analysis_data$date, label = TRUE))
If the range ends before December 2024, you need to:

Extend the to date in the tq_get() function.
Redo the feature engineering to include December data.
2. Extend the Data Range
If December 2024 data is missing, adjust the data download step:

R
Copy code
raw_data <- tq_get(
  faang_tickers,
  from = "2020-01-01",
  to = "2024-12-31",  # Extend to include December 2024
  get = "stock.prices"
)

# Save raw data
write_csv(raw_data, "data/01-raw_data/raw_data.csv")
Redo the feature engineering after downloading the updated data.

3. Debug Feature Engineering
Ensure the feature engineering process doesn’t remove December rows. Specifically:

Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, and other rolling features might cause NA for early December if November data is missing.
Add checks after mutate() to confirm the data includes December rows:

R
Copy code
analysis_data <- raw_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol))
  )

# Check for December rows
range(analysis_data$date)
4. Skip na.omit() if Needed
Using na.omit() can drop rows for early December if rolling or lagged features are incomplete. Instead, handle NA values explicitly:

R
Copy code
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .)))  # Replace NA with 0
5. Recheck Test Data
After extending the data and fixing feature engineering, confirm the test set includes December rows:

R
Copy code
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))

str(test)  # Ensure it is not empty

R
Copy code

  faang_tickers,
  from = "2020-01-01",
  to = "2024-12-31",  # Extend range
  get = "stock.prices"
)
write_csv(raw_data, "data/01-raw_data/raw_data.csv")

# Feature engineering
analysis_data <- raw_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol))
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .)))  # Handle NA

write_parquet(analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Split data

  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))

# Check test data
str(test)  # Ensure it contains rows
Expected Fix
After extending the data range and fixing feature engineering:

The test dataset will include December 2024 rows.
X_test will no longer be empty, and predictions will work as expected.

You said:
there's no december data in analysis_data
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If there's no December 2024 data in analysis_data, it's likely because either:

The raw data (raw_data) itself does not include dates beyond November 2024.
The feature engineering process removed rows for early December due to lagged or rolling calculations that depend on data from previous days (e.g., November).
Let's fix this by ensuring December data is included.

Steps to Fix
1. Verify Raw Data
First, confirm whether raw_data includes December 2024 data. Run:

R
Copy code
range(raw_data$date)
unique(lubridate::month(raw_data$date, label = TRUE))
If raw_data ends in November 2024:

Update the data downloading step to extend to December 31, 2024:
R
Copy code
# Extend the data range to include December 2024
raw_data <- tq_get(
  faang_tickers,
  from = "2020-01-01",
  to = "2024-12-31",  # Extend to include December 2024
  get = "stock.prices"
)

# Save updated raw data
write_csv(raw_data, "data/01-raw_data/raw_data.csv")
2. Debug Feature Engineering
If raw_data includes December data but it is missing in analysis_data, the issue is likely due to feature engineering. Lagged or rolling calculations remove rows for early December because they require prior data (e.g., from November). To prevent this, ensure lagged features don’t drop rows unnecessarily.

Key Fixes in Feature Engineering
Use the fill parameter with NA values for rolling functions to preserve rows.
Replace NA values introduced during lagging with a default (e.g., 0).
R
Copy code
analysis_data <- raw_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),  # Add lagged values
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),  # Rolling mean
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),  # 20-day SMA
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),  # 50-day SMA
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),  # Rolling volatility
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1  # Daily return
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol))  # Encode symbol as numeric
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .)))  # Replace NA with 0
Check again for December data:

R
Copy code
range(analysis_data$date)
unique(lubridate::month(analysis_data$date, label = TRUE))
3. Verify December Data in analysis_data
If analysis_data now contains December data, confirm that the test dataset is created correctly:

R
Copy code
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))

# Check the test dataset
str(test)
range(test$date)
4. Adjust Feature Engineering for Rolling Functions
If rolling functions (like Rolling_Mean_7) are causing missing rows for early December, explicitly extend the data range using November data where required. For example:

R
Copy code
# Ensure November data is available for early December calculations
analysis_data <- raw_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol)),
    across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))  # Handle missing values
  )

# Check if December rows exist
range(analysis_data$date)
5. Debug Test Data Creation
If December data still does not appear in test, ensure that:

The date filter for test is correctly applied.
The analysis_data includes all necessary rows.
R
Copy code
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))

# Confirm test dataset
str(test)
Final Workflow
Here’s the corrected pipeline:

R
Copy code
# Extend raw data to include December 2024
raw_data <- tq_get(
  faang_tickers,
  from = "2020-01-01",
  to = "2024-12-31",
  get = "stock.prices"
)
write_csv(raw_data, "data/01-raw_data/raw_data.csv")

# Feature engineering
analysis_data <- raw_data %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol)),
    across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))
  )
write_parquet(analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Check for December data
range(analysis_data$date)

# Split into training and test sets
train <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) < as.Date("2024-12-01"))

test <- analysis_data
You are correct that raw data cannot include December prices as today is December 2nd, and stock data is typically only available up to the current date. However, you can still predict December prices by leveraging your trained model to forecast future prices based on existing trends and features.

Here are your options:

1. Predict December Prices Using Forecasting
If you want to predict December prices, you need to simulate December data by extending the raw_data dataset with placeholder dates for December. You would then generate features (e.g., lagged values) based on historical data.

Steps to Predict December Prices
Extend the Dataset to Include December Dates Create a placeholder for December dates with no stock price data yet:

R
Copy code
# Generate placeholder dates for December
december_dates <- expand.grid(
  symbol = unique(raw_data$symbol),
  date = seq.Date(as.Date("2024-12-01"), as.Date("2024-12-31"), by = "day")
)
Simulate December Features Using November Data Use November's data to calculate features like Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, etc., for December:

R
Copy code
# Merge placeholder dates with raw_data
extended_data <- raw_data %>%
  bind_rows(december_dates) %>%
  arrange(symbol, date) %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Fill missing December values with 0 or interpolate
extended_data <- extended_data %>%
  mutate(across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .)))
Filter for December Data After generating features, select only December dates for prediction:

R
Copy code
december_test <- extended_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))
Predict December Prices Use the trained model to predict December prices based on the simulated features:

R
Copy code
# Prepare X_test for December
X_test_december <- december_test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Predict December prices
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test_december)
december_predictions <- predict(xgb_model, dtest)

# Add predictions to the December dataset
results_december <- december_test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = december_predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, predicted_adjusted)
2. Predict November Prices Instead
If you decide to focus on November, update your workflow to train on data before November and predict for November:

Updated Data Splitting
R
Copy code
# Train on data up to October 31, 2024
train <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-10-31"))

# Test on November data
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-11-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-11-30"))
Prepare Features and Predict
R
Copy code
# Prepare X_test for November
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Predict November prices
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test)
november_predictions <- predict(xgb_model, dtest)

# Add predictions to the November dataset
results_november <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = november_predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, adjusted, predicted_adjusted)
Visualization
Visualize the predictions for November:

R
Copy code
ggplot(results_november, aes(x = as.Date(date))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = adjusted, color = "Actual"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_adjusted, color = "Predicted"), linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~symbol, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs. Actual Stock Prices (November 2024)",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Stock Price",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the adjusted column for some groups (e.g., "AAPL") in your raw_data_extended dataset contains missing values (NA) even before applying the SMA() function. Since functions like SMA() and runSum() cannot handle NA values in their input, you need to address the missing data first.

Here’s how to fix it systematically:

Steps to Fix
1. Identify Missing Values in adjusted
Check for missing values in the adjusted column for each symbol:

R
Copy code
# Count NA values for each symbol
raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  summarize(missing_adjusted = sum(is.na(adjusted)))

# Inspect rows with NA values in the `adjusted` column
raw_data_extended %>%
  filter(is.na(adjusted))
If there are NA values in adjusted:

These might occur for the placeholder dates (December rows) or within existing data.
You need to decide how to handle them: either fill them with default values (e.g., 0) or interpolate based on nearby values.
2. Fill or Replace Missing Values
To handle the NA values in adjusted, choose one of the following strategies:

Option A: Fill Missing Values with 0
If missing values should be treated as zero (e.g., no price available):

R
Copy code
raw_data_extended <- raw_data_extended %>%
  mutate(adjusted = ifelse(is.na(adjusted), 0, adjusted))
Option B: Interpolate Missing Values
If missing values should be filled by interpolation (e.g., taking the average of adjacent values):

R
Copy code
library(zoo)

raw_data_extended <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(adjusted = na.approx(adjusted, na.rm = FALSE)) %>%  # Interpolate missing values
  ungroup()
Option C: Remove Missing Rows
If you want to drop rows with missing values in adjusted:

R
Copy code
raw_data_extended <- raw_data_extended %>%
  filter(!is.na(adjusted))
Choose the option that best suits your analysis.

3. Re-Run Feature Engineering
Once missing values are handled, retry the feature engineering step:

R
Copy code
analysis_data <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol)),
    across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))  # Handle remaining missing values
  )
4. Verify December Data
After fixing the adjusted column and completing feature engineering, confirm that December data is included:

R
Copy code
range(analysis_data$date)
Updated Code
Here’s the complete fixed script:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(TTR)
library(zoo)

# Handle missing values in the `adjusted` column
raw_data_extended <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(adjusted = na.approx(adjusted, na.rm = FALSE)) %>%  # Interpolate missing values
  ungroup()

# Feature Engineering
analysis_data <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol)),
    across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))  # Handle remaining missing values
  )

# Save cleaned data
write_parquet(analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")
Why This Works
na.approx() interpolates missing values in the adjusted column for smoother trends.
mutate(across(...)) ensures no residual NA values remain in the engineered features.
December rows are preserved because missing values are explicitly handled.
Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

You’re correct—the December data has placeholder rows with NA values in the adjusted column because we’re trying to predict prices for December. To fix this, we need to:

Simulate December values for features based on the most recent available data (e.g., November values).
Ensure December rows are included for prediction.

The error indicates that the SMA function fails because the adjusted column contains NA values in non-leading positions (i.e., not just at the start of the series). These NA values might be present due to interpolation errors or missing data that were not handled before feature calculation.

Here's how to resolve the issue:

Step-by-Step Solution
1. Debug Missing Values in adjusted
Check for missing values in the adjusted column for each symbol:

R
Copy code
raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  summarize(missing_adjusted = sum(is.na(adjusted))) %>%
  filter(missing_adjusted > 0)
If there are NA values, confirm whether these are:

In leading positions (e.g., early dates with no prior data).
Scattered in the series (e.g., due to missing interpolation).
2. Fill Missing Values in adjusted
Ensure the adjusted column is fully populated before calculating features. Use forward and backward filling to handle leading and trailing NA values:

R
Copy code
# Fill missing values in `adjusted` (forward and backward fill)
raw_data_extended <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(adjusted = na.locf(adjusted, na.rm = FALSE),  # Forward fill
         adjusted = na.locf(adjusted, na.rm = FALSE, fromLast = TRUE)) %>%  # Backward fill
  ungroup()
3. Recalculate Features
Now, calculate rolling features such as SMA, Rolling_Mean_7, etc., without encountering errors:

R
Copy code
analysis_data <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%

    across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))  # Replace any remaining NA with 0
  )
4. Verify Outputs
Ensure that analysis_data has no NA values and includes all necessary features:

R
Copy code
# Check for missing values
any(is.na(analysis_data))

# Check the structure
str(analysis_data)
Final Full Script
Here’s the complete script with fixes applied:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(TTR)
library(zoo)
library(arrow)

# Interpolate and fill missing values in `adjusted`
raw_data_extended <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    adjusted = na.locf(adjusted, na.rm = FALSE),  # Forward fill
    adjusted = na.locf(adjusted, na.rm = FALSE, fromLast = TRUE)  # Backward fill
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Feature Engineering
analysis_data <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol)),
    across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))  # Handle remaining missing values
  )

# Save cleaned and engineered data
write_parquet(analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")
Explanation
Filling Missing Values:

Forward and backward filling ensures the adjusted column is fully populated.
Handles leading and trailing NA values caused by placeholder December rows or missing data.
Rolling Features:

fill = NA in rolling functions ensures no rows are dropped prematurely.
Final mutate(across(...)) replaces any remaining NA with 0 for smooth calculations.
Output Verification:

Ensures analysis_data is clean and ready for modeling and predictions.

Here’s the complete workflow for data cleaning, modeling, and prediction using the updated methodology to handle missing data and predict December 2024 stock prices.

1. Data Cleaning
This step includes downloading the raw data, simulating December rows, interpolating missing values, and engineering features.

R
Copy code
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(TTR)
library(zoo)
library(arrow)
library(readr)

# Load raw data
raw_data <- read_csv("data/01-raw_data/raw_data.csv")

# Generate placeholder dates for December
december_dates <- expand.grid(
  symbol = unique(raw_data$symbol),
  date = seq.Date(as.Date("2024-12-01"), as.Date("2024-12-31"), by = "day")
)

# Bind placeholder dates with raw_data
raw_data_extended <- raw_data %>%
  bind_rows(december_dates) %>%
  arrange(symbol, date)

# Interpolate and fill missing values in `adjusted`
raw_data_extended <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    adjusted = na.locf(adjusted, na.rm = FALSE),  # Forward fill
    adjusted = na.locf(adjusted, na.rm = FALSE, fromLast = TRUE)  # Backward fill
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Feature Engineering
analysis_data <- raw_data_extended %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  mutate(
    Lag_1 = lag(adjusted, 1),
    Rolling_Mean_7 = rollmean(adjusted, 7, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    sma_20 = SMA(adjusted, n = 20),
    sma_50 = SMA(adjusted, n = 50),
    volatility = runSD(adjusted, n = 20),
    daily_return = (adjusted / lag(adjusted)) - 1
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    symbol_encoded = as.numeric(as.factor(symbol)),
    across(Lag_1:daily_return, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))  # Handle remaining missing values
  )

# Save cleaned and engineered data
write_parquet(analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")
2. Data Modeling
Train an XGBoost model using data up to November 30, 2024.

R
Copy code
# Load libraries
library(xgboost)

# Load cleaned data
analysis_data <- read_parquet("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Split into training and testing sets
train <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) < as.Date("2024-12-01"))

# Prepare training features and labels
X_train <- train %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()
y_train <- as.numeric(train$adjusted)

# Train the XGBoost model
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
xgb_model <- xgboost(
  data = dtrain,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.1,
  nrounds = 100,
  objective = "reg:squarederror",
  verbose = 0
)

# Save trained model
saveRDS(xgb_model, "models/xgb_model.rds")
3. Prediction
Predict December 2024 stock prices using the trained model.

R
Copy code
# Load the trained model
xgb_model <- readRDS("models/xgb_model.rds")

# Filter December data for prediction
test <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) >= as.Date("2024-12-01") & as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-12-31"))

# Prepare testing features
X_test <- test %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Predict December prices
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test)
predictions <- predict(xgb_model, dtest)

# Combine predictions with December data
results <- test %>%
  mutate(predicted_adjusted = predictions) %>%
  select(date, symbol, predicted_adjusted)

# Save predictions
write_csv(results, "data/03-results/faang_predictions_december_2024.csv")

# View results
head(results)
4. Visualization
Visualize the predicted prices for December 2024.

R
Copy code

To create both November and December models, each trained on appropriate datasets and saved with the desired filenames, here’s how you can structure the scripts:

November Model
R
Copy code
# November Model Training

# Train on data up to October 31, 2024
nov_train <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-10-31"))

# Prepare November training features (X_train) and labels (y_train)
X_train_nov <- nov_train %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%
  as.matrix()
y_train_nov <- as.numeric(nov_train$adjusted)

# Train the November XGBoost model
dtrain_nov <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train_nov, label = y_train_nov)
nov_model <- xgboost(
  data = dtrain_nov,
  max.depth = 6,
  eta = 0.1,
  nrounds = 100,
  objective = "reg:squarederror",
  verbose = 0
)

# Save November model
saveRDS(nov_model, "models/nov_model.rds")
December Model
R
Copy code
# December Model Training

# Train on data up to November 30, 2024
dec_train <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-11-30"))

# Prepare December training features (X_train) and labels (y_train)
X_train_dec <- dec_train %>%
  select(Lag_1, Rolling_Mean_7, sma_20, sma_50, volatility, daily_return, symbol_encoded) %>%

 4. dplyr:::select.data.frame(., date, symbol, error)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the column error does not exist in your nov_results dataset. To create the error column, you need to calculate the difference between actual and predicted values first. Here's how you can fix the issue:

Correct Script to Add error Column and Generate Heatmap Data
R
Copy code
# Add the `error` column to `nov_results`
nov_results <- nov_results %>%
  mutate(error = abs(adjusted - predicted_adjusted))  # Calculate absolute error

# Prepare heatmap data
nov_heatmap_data <- nov_results %>%
  select(date, symbol, error) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = error)  # Reshape data for heatmap
Heatmap Visualization
R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

# Reshape data for ggplot heatmap
heatmap_data <- melt(nov_heatmap_data, id.vars = "date", variable.name = "symbol", value.name = "error")

# Plot heatmap
ggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = as.Date(date), y = symbol, fill = error)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red", midpoint = median(heatmap_data$error, na.rm = TRUE)) +
  labs(
    title = "Heatmap of Prediction Errors for November 2024",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Stock Symbol",
    fill = "Error"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
Explanation:
Error Calculation:

Adds an error column to the nov_results dataset, calculating the absolute difference between actual (adjusted) and predicted (predicted_adjusted) values.
Reshaping Data:

Uses pivot_wider() to convert the data into a format suitable for heatmaps, with symbol as the row variable, date as the column variable, and error as the value.
Heatmap:

Displays prediction errors using a gradient color scheme (blue for low errors, red for high errors).

how to make this look nicer
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To make this box plot more visually appealing, here are some suggestions along with the updated script:

Improvements
Color Palette:

Use a color palette with better contrast for "November" and "December."
Example: Use scale_fill_manual() for custom colors.
Axis Labels:

Adjust the font size and alignment of axis labels for better readability.
Use theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) to tilt x-axis labels.
Title and Legends:

Improve the plot title for clarity.
Add a legend title and position it at the top or bottom for balance.
Box Width:

Adjust the width of the boxes using geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) to avoid overlapping.
Grid Lines:

Use subtle grid lines to enhance readability without making the plot cluttered.
Updated Script
R
Copy code
ggplot(combined_results, aes(x = symbol, y = predicted_adjusted, fill = month)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.6, outlier.shape = 21, outlier.size = 2, outlier.fill = "white", outlier.color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("November" = "#F8766D", "December" = "#00BFC4")) +  # Custom colors
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Predicted Stock Prices for November and December 2024",
    subtitle = "FAANG Stock Predictions Using the Unified Model",
    x = "Stock Symbol",
    y = "Predicted Stock Price (in USD)",
    fill = "Month"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Cleaner theme with adjusted font size
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",  # Place legend on top
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12),  # Adjust x-axis labels
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 13, face = "italic", hjust = 0.5)
  )
Key Features of the Updated Script:
Colors:

November in a warm color (#F8766D) and December in a cool color (#00BFC4).
Outliers:

Improved outlier visibility with white fill and black borders.
Titles and Legends:

Added a subtitle and improved the legend title.
Positioned the legend at the top for better balance.
Readability:

Adjusted text sizes and tilted x-axis labels for clarity.
Grid Lines:

The minimal theme ensures subtle grid lines without distraction.
This will result in a much cleaner and professional visualization, suitable for your results section. Let me know if you'd like further tweaks!






You said:

i can't see the colours because boxplot is too small, is there a better visualization or a way to improve?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To make the differences more visible, there are two primary solutions:

Option 1: Adjust the Boxplot Design
Increase Box Width:
Use a larger width in geom_boxplot() to make the boxes more prominent.
Add Transparency (Alpha):
Introduce slight transparency to the boxes using alpha to allow overlapping colors to show.
Separate Boxes by Month:
Use position_dodge() to separate November and December boxes for each stock symbol.
Option 2: Use a Violin Plot
A violin plot can show the distribution of predicted prices for November and December more clearly. Violin plots are particularly useful when dealing with overlapping data.

Updated Visualization Script (Boxplot with Adjustments)
R
Copy code
ggplot(combined_results, aes(x = symbol, y = predicted_adjusted, fill = month)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = 0.6,
    outlier.shape = 21,  # Circular outliers
    outlier.size = 2,
    outlier.fill = "white",
    outlier.color = "black",
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)  # Dodge boxes for separation
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("November" = "#F8766D", "December" = "#00BFC4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Predicted Stock Prices for November and December 2024",
    x = "Stock Symbol",
    y = "Predicted Stock Price (in USD)",
    fill = "Month"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
  )
Alternative Visualization: Violin Plot
R
Copy code
ggplot(combined_results, aes(x = symbol, y = predicted_adjusted, fill = month)) +
  geom_violin(
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),  # Separate violins for each month
    alpha = 0.8  # Slight transparency
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("November" = "#F8766D", "December" = "#00BFC4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Predicted Stock Prices for November and December 2024",
    x = "Stock Symbol",
    y = "Predicted Stock Price (in USD)",
    fill = "Month"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
  )
Recommendations
If you want to maintain the boxplot, increase box width and use position dodge to separate the months visually.
If you prefer a more modern and informative visualization, use a violin plot to show the distribution more effectively.





You said:

it is still hard to see
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the boxplot visualization is still hard to interpret, here are some alternative strategies or updates to make it more readable and visually appealing:

Option 1: Separate Panels for Each Stock Symbol
Use facets to create individual plots for each stock symbol.
This reduces clutter and ensures each boxplot is clearly visible.
R
Copy code
ggplot(combined_results, aes(x = month, y = predicted_adjusted, fill = month)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = 0.5,
    outlier.shape = 21,
    outlier.size = 2,
    outlier.fill = "white",
    outlier.color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("November" = "#F8766D", "December" = "#00BFC4")) +
  facet_wrap(~symbol, scales = "free_y") +  # Separate panels by stock symbol
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Predicted Stock Prices for November and December 2024",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Predicted Stock Price (in USD)",
    fill = "Month"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",  # Remove redundant legend
    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
  )
Option 2: Switch to a Bar Chart
Use the average predicted prices for November and December.
A bar chart simplifies the comparison and avoids issues with overlapping.
R
Copy code
avg_predicted_prices <- combined_results %>%
  group_by(symbol, month) %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(predicted_adjusted, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(avg_predicted_prices, aes(x = symbol, y = mean_price, fill = month)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("November" = "#F8766D", "December" = "#00BFC4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Predicted Stock Prices for November and December 2024",
    x = "Stock Symbol",
    y = "Average Predicted Price (in USD)",
    fill = "Month"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
  )
Option 3: Violin Plot with Facets
Similar to the boxplot but shows the distribution of predicted prices more vividly.
R
Copy code
ggplot(combined_results, aes(x = month, y = predicted_adjusted, fill = month)) +
  geom_violin(
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),

To switch the order so that "November" appears before "December" in the bar chart, you can reorder the month variable in your dataset. Here's the updated script:

R
Copy code
# Reorder the month factor so that "November" comes before "December"
avg_predicted_prices <- avg_predicted_prices %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = c("November", "December")))

# Plot with the updated order
ggplot(avg_predicted_prices, aes(x = symbol, y = mean_price, fill = month)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("November" = "#F8766D", "December" = "#00BFC4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Predicted Stock Prices for November and December 2024",
    x = "Stock Symbol",
    y = "Average Predicted Price (in USD)",
    fill = "Month"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
  )
This will reorder the bars so that "November" comes first, followed by "December."

## Variables

The dataset includes the following original and constructed variables relevant to the analysis of stock price patterns:

### Original Variables
- **symbol**: The stock ticker symbol, identifying the company (e.g., GOOG for Google).
- **date**: The trading date, essential for tracking time-based patterns.
- **open**: The stock’s opening price on a given day, indicating initial market sentiment.
- **high**: The highest price during the trading day, capturing upward volatility.
- **low**: The lowest price during the trading day, capturing downward volatility.
- **close**: The stock’s closing price, used as the primary outcome variable in the model.
- **volume**: Total shares traded, reflecting market activity and investor interest.
- **adjusted**: The closing price adjusted for corporate actions like splits or dividends, providing a normalized measure of value.

### Constructed Variables
- **Price_Lag1**: The closing price from the previous trading day, derived using lag(). This variable captures momentum and sequential trends in stock prices.
- **Price_Diff**: The difference between the current day’s closing price and the previous day’s, calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Price\_Diff} = \text{close} - \text{Price\_Lag1}
  \]
  This variable quantifies absolute daily price fluctuations.

- **Price_Change_Percent**: The percentage change in stock price relative to the previous day, calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Price_Change_Percent} = \frac{\text{close} - \text{Price_Lag1}}{\text{Price_Lag1}} \times 100
  $$
  This metric normalizes price changes, allowing for meaningful comparisons across time.

- **Weekly_Avg_Close**: A 7-day moving average of the closing price, constructed using rollmean(). This metric smooths short-term fluctuations to highlight weekly trends.

- **Monthly_Avg_Close**: A 30-day moving average of the closing price, capturing longer-term trends.

- **Volatility**: The 7-day rolling standard deviation of closing prices, computed using rollapply(). This variable measures short-term price variability, reflecting market stability or instability.

These variables provide a robust foundation for analyzing and predicting stock price behavior. They capture both raw market indicators and constructed metrics that reflect trends, volatility, and momentum.

### Outcome Variable

The outcome variable for this analysis is the **daily closing price (close)**, which serves as a standard measure of stock performance. The model aims to predict this variable using historical data and derived features.

### Predictor Variables

To forecast the daily closing price (close), the model employs a comprehensive set of predictors derived from the cleaned dataset:

- **Price_Lag1**: The previous day’s closing price, capturing recent trends in stock movement.
- **Price_Change_Percent**: The proportional change in stock price compared to the previous day, normalizing variations across time.
- **Weekly_Avg_Close**: A smoothed metric of weekly price trends, reducing the impact of short-term volatility.
- **Monthly_Avg_Close**: A broader measure of stock performance, capturing monthly trends.
- **Volatility**: A measure of short-term variability, highlighting the extent of daily price fluctuations.
- **volume**: Daily trading activity, which often correlates with significant price movements.
- **open**, **high**, **low**: Intraday price metrics that reflect trading behavior throughout the day.

By leveraging these variables, the analysis captures temporal patterns, market activity, and volatility, providing a comprehensive framework for predicting daily stock price movements.

#### Original Variables
The original variables directly obtained from the raw stock price data are:
- **`symbol`**: The stock ticker symbol identifying the company (e.g., AAPL for Apple, AMZN for Amazon).
- **`date`**: The trading date, essential for analyzing time-series trends.
- **`open`**: The stock’s opening price for the trading day, indicating initial market conditions.
- **`high`**: The highest price reached during the trading day, reflecting intraday volatility.
- **`low`**: The lowest price during the trading day, reflecting downward market trends.
- **`close`**: The stock’s unadjusted closing price, representing the final value at the end of trading.
- **`volume`**: The total number of shares traded during the day, reflecting market activity.
- **`adjusted`**: The closing price adjusted for corporate actions such as splits or dividends, ensuring consistency for trend analysis.

#### Constructed Variables
The constructed variables were engineered to enhance the model's predictive performance by capturing price trends, volatility, and momentum:
- **`Lag_1`**: The closing price from the previous trading day, derived using the `lag()` function. This variable captures sequential patterns in stock prices.
- **`Rolling_Mean_7`**: A 7-day moving average of adjusted closing prices, computed using the `rollmean()` function. This variable smooths short-term fluctuations to highlight weekly trends.
- **`sma_20`**: The 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of adjusted prices, reflecting medium-term price trends.
- **`sma_50`**: The 50-day simple moving average of adjusted prices, providing insights into longer-term trends.
- **`volatility`**: The 20-day rolling standard deviation of adjusted prices, capturing short-term price variability.
- **`daily_return`**: The percentage change in adjusted closing prices relative to the previous day, calculated as:
  \[
  \text{daily\_return} = \frac{\text{adjusted}}{\text{Lag\_1}} - 1
  \]
  This variable normalizes price changes for comparability across time and stocks.
- **`symbol_encoded`**: A numeric encoding of the stock ticker symbol, allowing the categorical `symbol` variable to be included in the modeling process.

#### Outcome Variable
The **outcome variable** for this analysis is the **adjusted closing price (`adjusted`)**, which serves as the target for prediction. This variable provides a normalized measure of stock value that accounts for corporate actions like stock splits or dividends.

#### Predictor Variables
The predictor variables used to model the adjusted closing price are:
- **`Lag_1`**: The prior day's adjusted closing price, reflecting momentum.
- **`Rolling_Mean_7`**: A smoothed metric capturing weekly price trends.
- **`sma_20`** and **`sma_50`**: Simple moving averages representing medium- and long-term price trends.
- **`volatility`**: The short-term price variability, highlighting potential risks.
- **`daily_return`**: The normalized daily percentage price change.
- **`symbol_encoded`**: A numerical representation of the stock ticker symbol, capturing company-level differences.

Together, these variables provide a robust framework for understanding and predicting stock price movements over time, leveraging both raw market indicators and derived metrics.
This section follows a structured and clear format, identifying key original variables, engineered features, and their roles in the analysis. It also provides mathematical definitions where appropriate, ensuring transparency in the variable construction process.

Given the structure of your combined_results object, you can create the avg_predicted_prices object by calculating the mean of predicted_adjusted grouped by symbol and month, and then reorder the month factor so that "November" comes before "December." Here's the script:

Script
R
Copy code
# Calculate average predicted prices for November and December
avg_predicted_prices <- combined_results %>%
  group_by(symbol, month) %>%
  summarize(avg_price = mean(predicted_adjusted, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Reorder the month factor so that "November" comes before "December"
avg_predicted_prices <- avg_predicted_prices %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = c("November", "December")))

# View the result
print(avg_predicted_prices)
Explanation:
Grouping by symbol and month: The group_by() function groups the data by stock symbol and month.
Calculating Mean: The summarize() function computes the average predicted price (avg_price) for each group.
Reordering Month: The mutate() function reorders the month column to ensure "November" appears before "December" in visualizations or tables.
